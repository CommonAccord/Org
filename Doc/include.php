These folders present a surfeit of examples, including the really good ones linked from <a href="http://commonaccord.org/index.php?action=demo">here</a>.  <br>The more focused work - and the core of a fully-codified approach to legal documents is at /02/ below.  The most focused work - and materials from the #DecentLaw conference at MIT and Harvard, is at /03/ - Think of it as a 0.3 release of the code of everything legal.  We are some distance, but the goal is in sight.<br>So the future is something like what is shown in /03/.  The rest is history and resource. As with long division, it shows our work.
