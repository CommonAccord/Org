These folders present a substantial part of the history of the project and available materials.  More recently, some of the best work is on other sites, such as <a href="http://my.commonaccord.org">my.commonaccord.org</a> and <a href="http://ga4gh.commonaccord.org">ga4gh.commonaccord.org</a>.<br>We're working on how to organize this better. One thought is to rename this site and start over again with only the most codified materials.
