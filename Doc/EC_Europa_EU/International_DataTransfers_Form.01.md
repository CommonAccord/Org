Ti=Standard Contractual Clauses (processors)

Intro.Agree=HAVE AGREED on the following Contractual Clauses (the {Clauses}) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by {the_data_exporter} to the data importer of the {personal_data} specified in Appendix 1.

1.Ti=Definitions

1.0.sec=For the purposes of the {Clauses}:

1.1.sec='{personal_data}', '{special_categories_of_data}', '{process}/{processing}', '{controller}', '{processor}', '{data_subject}' and '{supervisory_authority}' shall have the same meaning as in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the {processing} of {personal_data} and on the free movement of such data;

1.2.sec='{the_data_exporter}' means the {controller} who transfers the {personal_data};

1.3.sec='{the_data_importer}' means the {processor} who agrees to receive from {the_data_exporter} {personal_data} intended for {processing} on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and the terms of the {Clauses} and who is not subject to a third country's system ensuring adequate protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC;

1.4.sec='{the_subprocessor}' means any {processor} engaged by {the_data_importer} or by any other {subprocessor} of {the_data_importer} who agrees to receive from {the_data_importer} or from any other {subprocessor} of {the_data_importer} {personal_data} exclusively intended for {processing} activities to be carried out on behalf of {the_data_exporter} after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the terms of the {Clauses} and the terms of the written subcontract;

1.5.sec='{the_applicable_data_protection_law}' means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the {processing} of {personal_data} applicable to a data {controller} in the Member State in which {the_data_exporter} is established;

Note=The {Clauses} use the phrase "security measures".  It appears that means the same thing as "technical and organisational security measures."

1.6.sec='{technical_and_organisational_security_measures}' means those measures aimed at protecting {personal_data} against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the {processing} involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of {processing}.

2.Ti=Details of the transfer

2.sec=The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of {personal_data} where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 which forms an integral part of the {Clauses}.

3.Ti=Third-party beneficiary clause

3.1.sec=The {data_subject} can enforce against {the_data_exporter} this Clause, Clause 4(b) to (i), Clause 5(a) to (e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party beneficiary.

3.2.sec=The {data_subject} can enforce against {the_data_importer} this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where {the_data_exporter} has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of {the_data_exporter} by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of {the_data_exporter}, in which case the {data_subject} can enforce them against such entity. 

3.3.sec=The {data_subject} can enforce against {the_subprocessor} this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both {the_data_exporter} and {the_data_importer} have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of {the_data_exporter} by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of {the_data_exporter}, in which case the {data_subject} can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of {the_subprocessor} shall be limited to its own {processing} operations under the {Clauses}. 

3.4.sec=The parties do not object to a {data_subject} being represented by an association or other body if the {data_subject} so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law.

11.2.sec=The prior written contract between {the_data_importer} and {the_subprocessor} shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the {data_subject} is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against {the_data_exporter} or {the_data_importer} because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of {the_data_exporter} or {data_importer} by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of {the_subprocessor} shall be limited to its own {processing} operations under the {Clauses}.

11.3.sec=The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which {the_data_exporter} is established, namely {Law.State.the}.

11.4.sec={The_data_exporter} shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the {Clauses} and notified by {the_data_importer} pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to {the_data_exporter}'s data protection {supervisory_authority}. 

11.=[02/Bit/Ssec_04]

12.Ti=Obligation after the termination of {personal_data} {processing} services

12.1.sec=The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data {processing} services, {the_data_importer} and {the_subprocessor} shall, at the choice of {the_data_exporter}, return all the {personal_data} transferred and the copies thereof to {the_data_exporter} or shall destroy all the {personal_data} and certify to {the_data_exporter} that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon {the_data_importer} prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the {personal_data} transferred. In that case, {the_data_importer} warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the {personal_data} transferred and will not actively {process} the {personal_data} transferred anymore.

12.2.sec={The_data_importer} and {the_subprocessor} warrant that upon request of {the_data_exporter} and/or of the {supervisory_authority}, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.
