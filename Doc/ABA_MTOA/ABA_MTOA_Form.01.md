AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement”) dated as of _________], 20__, among [Parent], a ___________________ ("Parent”), [Purchaser], a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser”), and [Target], a Delaware corporation (the "Company”).

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, Parent shall cause Purchaser to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer”) to purchase any (subject to the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined below)) and all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $__ per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock”), at a price per share of Company Common Stock of $[____] (such amount, or any other amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the "Offer Price”), net to the seller in cash, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, the Company Board has resolved to recommend that the holders of the Company Common Stock accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer;

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company have approved the merger (the "Merger”) of Purchaser into the Company, on the terms and conditions set forth herein; 

WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that the Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected as soon as practicable following [consummation] of the Offer; [NTD:  Clarify/discuss "consummation” in context of tender offer]

COMMENT:

Back-End Merger

The tender offer, assuming the purchase of shares is consummated, will result in the acquisition by the buyer of shares from shareholders accepting the offer, but other shareholders will continue to hold their shares.  If the buyer seeks to own 100% of the target company (as is assumed to be the case in the Model Agreement), the buyer will need to effect a "back-end” merger to squeeze out the remaining shares.  

The means by which the back-end merger may be accomplished, and the timing of the back-end merger, will depend largely on the portion of the target company’s shares that the buyer owns following completion of the tender offer:

•	The target company could call a shareholder meeting and have its shareholders vote on the back-end merger, with the approval of the merger assured since the buyer will own at least a majority of the target company’s outstanding shares.

•	Alternatively, most states allow the holder of a specified percentage of the target company’s shares to effect the merger without holding a shareholder vote (known as a "short-form” merger).  In Delaware, the requisite percentage traditionally has been 90%, though in 2013 the applicable statute was changed to allow a buyer in a tender offer to effect the back-end merger if it owned a simple majority of the target company’s outstanding shares, subject to other conditions described below.

Back-End Mergers Before Section 251

Prior to the effectiveness of Section 251(h) of the DGCL in August, 2013, the back-end merger could be accomplished as either a "long-form” merger under Section 251(c) of the DGCL or as a "short-form” merger under either Section 253 (when the purchaser is a corporation) or Section 267 (when the purchaser is an alternative entity) of the DGCL.  

Long-Form Merger.  A long-form merger requires a vote of the target company stockholders which results in significant delay between the close of the front-end tender offer and close of the back-end merger, even though approval of the back-end merger is assured (due to the acquisition of target stock by Purchaser through the Offer).  

If the target stockholders will hold a meeting to vote on the merger, the target company must prepare a proxy statement, clear the proxy statement with the SEC and mail the proxy statement at least 20 calendar days under Delaware law, or up to 20 business days under applicable SEC rules, before the date of the meeting.  See Section 251(c) of the DGCL and Note D.3 to Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act.  Even where action by written consent in lieu of a stockholder meeting is permitted by the target’s governing documents, under Section 14(c) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14c-2 thereunder, an information statement must be prepared and sent to stockholders at least 20 calendar days prior to closing of the merger.  .

A delay between closing of the front-end tender offer and the back-end merger can result in problems for the bidder, such as the inability of the bidder to utilize assets of the target as loan collateral prior to closing of the merger and delaying the time when the bidder can exercise full control over the target. 1  Similarly, such a delay results in lost time value of money to target stockholders who did not tender their shares into the Offer

Short-Form Merger.  A short-form merger avoids these timing issues.  The short-form merger statutes provide that a parent entity owning at least 90% of each class of shares of the target entitled to vote on a merger may effect such merger without any action by the board of directors or stockholders of the target.  However, receiving tenders from holders of 90% of the outstanding shares of a public company may be difficult, given the presence of non-responsive, or "dead,” shares, and possible opposition by even a small minority of shares.

To avoid the delay associated with a long-form back-end merger, while making the minimum tender necessary to effect a short-form merger more realistically obtainable, two potential solutions were developed.  

•	Subsequent Offering Period.  The first solution was a regulatory solution.  In 1999, the SEC adopted Rule 14d-11, authorizing a subsequent offering period, in part to "assist bidders in reaching the statutory state law minimum necessary to engage in a short-form, back-end merger with the target.”  See Comment to Section 1.01(d).

•	Top-Up Option.  The second solution  was a market-developed solution:  the top-up option.  A top-up option permits a bidder in a tender offer to acquire ownership of 90% of the outstanding shares of the target’s stock even though it owns less than 90% after completion of the tender offer.  Such an option permits an acquiror that has consummated the front-end tender offer to "top-up” its ownership of target stock to 90% to permit a short-form merger by purchasing newly issued or treasury shares.  The effectiveness of a top-up option, however, is dependent upon the number of authorized but unissued or treasury shares the target has.  As a rule of thumb, for every 1% that an acquiror’s ownership falls short of the 90% short-form threshold, a number of target shares equal to 10% of the target’s outstanding stock prior to the offer must be issued to the acquiror under the top-up option.  See Comment to Section 1.03.

Back-End Mergers under Section 251

Section 251(h) of the DGCL, adopted in 2013, permits a merger agreement to contain a provision obviating the need for a stockholder vote for a back-end long-form merger following consummation of a tender offer if certain conditions are met.  Section 251(h) specifies that, unless otherwise required by the target corporation’s certificate of incorporation, no vote of stockholders of the target corporation is necessary to authorize a merger with another corporation if the target corporation’s shares are listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, and the following conditions are satisfied: 

(i)	the merger agreement expressly provides the merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) and shall be effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the first-step tender offer, 

(ii)	the purchaser consummates a tender offer for any and all of the outstanding stock of the target corporation that, absent Section 251(h), would be entitled to vote on the adoption of the merger, 

(iii)	following the consummation of the offer, the purchaser owns at least such percentage of the target corporation’s stock, and of each class and series thereof, required by the DGCL to adopt the merger agreement or any higher threshold required by the target’s certificate of incorporation, 

(iv)	at the time the target’s board approves the merger agreement, no other party to the merger agreement is an "interested stockholder” of the target as defined in Section 203(c) of the DGCL, 

(v)	the purchaser merges with or into the target corporation, and 

(vi)	the same amount and kind of consideration is paid to the target stockholders in the back-end merger as offered in the first-step tender offer.

Limits on Use of Section 251.  The Model Agreement is drafted assuming the merger will be governed under Section 251(h).  However, structuring a two-step transaction under the traditional approach of using a top-up option and back-end short-form merger could still be advisable for targets incorporated outside of Delaware and in certain additional circumstances, including the following:

1.01.(1).(1).sec=	For tax or other reasons, the parties desire that the purchaser be anything other than a corporation;

1.01.(1).(2).sec=	The purchaser is an "interested stockholder” as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL; 

(iii) [OTHERS?  LARGE ROLL?]

Accordingly, certain provisions of this Model Agreement, set off in brackets, are included by way of example only, and assume Section 251(h) were inapplicable to the transaction.

[WHEREAS, as a condition to and inducement to Parent’s willingness to enter into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are entering into stockholder support agreements with Parent and Purchaser (the "Support Agreements”);] and

COMMENT:

Regardless of whether the business combination restrictions of Section 203 of the DGCL are applicable to the transaction, Section 251(h) of the DGCL will be unavailable to the parties, at the time the target board approves the merger agreement, a party to the agreement is an "interested stockholder” of the target as that term is defined in Section 203(c) of the DGCL.

Section 203(c) generally provides that a person is an "interested stockholder” if that person, among other alternatives, "has any agreement, arrangement or understanding” for the purpose of acquiring or disposing of 15% or more of the target stock.  If support agreements as to 15% or more of the target stock are sought by the bidder, the bidder should be mindful of not becoming an interested stockholder prior to the time that the target board approves the merger agreement.  On this note, see Siegman v. Columbia Pictures Entm’t, Inc., 576 A.2d 625 (Del. Ch. 1989); Siegman v. Columbia Pictures Entm’t, Inc., 1993 WL 10969 (Del. Ch. Jan. 15, 1993).

[NTD:  Add comment re: distinguish from non-support agreements described with respect to best price rule]   

WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the Merger;

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE OFFER

1.01.Ti=	The Offer.

1.01.(1).sec=	Subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, commence the Offer within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than five (5) business days) after the date of this Agreement.  The obligations of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of the Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the conditions set forth in Annex A.

COMMENT:

Section 1.01(a) describes the basic parameters within which Purchaser must commence the Offer.  Thus, it requires that the Offer (i) comply with applicable SEC rules, (ii) be commenced within a specified time period and (iii) be subject only to the conditions set forth in Annex A.

The timing of the commencement of the Offer is frequently negotiated.  Often, both parties would like to start, and finish, the Offer as quickly as possible.  Since the Offer, whenever commenced, must under SEC rules remain open for at least 20 business days, and more if the SEC has comments that take longer than that to resolve and, if applicable, disseminate to Company stockholders, any delay in commencement will also delay the closing.  However, Purchaser may be concerned that it will be delayed for logistical or other reasons, and does not want to commit contractually to something it is not sure it can deliver.  

In some cases, the Company may want to require some delay, such as where the Company Board wishes to allow a further market check; such a delay would be intended to give potential competing bidders additional time in which to prepare and submit an offer.  An alternative method to allowing this additional time for competing bidders would be to allow or require Purchaser to commence the Offer (and hence to start the SEC review process) but to allow the Company to extend or delay the expiration of the Offer (see comment to Sec. 1.01(d)).  

Purchaser also may wish to delay commencing the Offer in order to [permit it to commence regulatory filings, where applicable, or to make progress in regards to obtaining definitive financing for its Offer].

Prior to its amendment in 2000, Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act specified that an offer commenced upon public announcement of certain limited information about the offer and that a tender offer statement must be filed by the bidder within five business days of announcement or the offer must be withdrawn.  While that requirement has been eliminated, many agreements continue to make express provision for commencement for the reasons described above.

1.01.(2).sec=	The initial scheduled expiration date of the Offer shall be midnight (New York City time) on the twentieth (20th) business day following commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act).

COMMENT:

Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act requires that the Offer remain open for no less than 20 business days from the date the Offer is first published or sent to security holders.  Under Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act, both the date the Offer is commenced and, if the Offer expires at midnight, the date the Offer expires may be counted toward the 20 business day period.

Note, though, that while offers seeking to count the date of expiration towards the 20 business day minimum or towards certain extensions required by the SEC may need to expire at midnight, offers extended for other reasons (for example, to solicit additional tenders where the minimum tender condition is not met at the end of the initial tender period or extended pending receipt of required regulatory approvals) may be able to close earlier in the day, such as at 5:00 p.m. New York time.  

1.01.(3).sec=	Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive, in whole or in part, any condition to the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not:

(i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, 

(ii) subject to Section 1.01(g) hereof, reduce the Offer Price, 

(iii) waive or amend the Minimum Tender Condition, add to the conditions set forth in Annex A, modify any condition set forth in Annex A in any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock, or impose conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex A, 

(iv) except as otherwise provided in Section 1.01(d), extend the Offer, 

(v) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or 

(vi) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock.

COMMENT:

Paragraph (c) restricts on the ability of Purchaser to modify the terms of the Offer.  Absent such restrictions, Purchaser would be able to impose additional conditions or waive certain conditions in a way that would be inconsistent with the fundamental assumptions of the Company Board in agreeing to the two-step structure, including by closing the Offer without receiving the support of holders of a majority of the Company’s shares or by changing the form of the consideration paid to shareholders.

The SEC imposes some timing and disclosure requirements that apply if Purchaser changes the Offer in certain ways, whether with or without the agreement of the Company.  In particular, if Purchaser increases or decreases the percentage of the class of securities sought, the consideration offered or the dealer’s soliciting fee (for this purpose the acceptance of an additional amount of up to two percent of the class of securities sought is not deemed to be an increase), then under Rule 14e-1(b) under the Exchange Act the Offer must remain open for at least 10 business days from the date notice of such change is given to the shareholders.  

1.01.(4).sec=	Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall extend the Offer for the minimum period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer.  

In addition, if at the otherwise scheduled expiration date of the Offer any condition to the Offer is not satisfied (or, to the extent permitted hereby, waived), Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer for one (1) or more consecutive increments of not more than ten (10) business days each (or for such longer period as may be agreed by the Company); provided, that Purchaser shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

COMMENT:

The requirement that Purchaser extend the Offer when a condition to the Offer is not satisfied (or duly waived), and the Company’s ability to allow longer periods of extension, provide the Company with the flexibility to keep the Offer alive and allow the Company to address issues that may arise in a cooperative way with Purchaser.  For example, if it takes more than the Offer’s initially scheduled 20 business days to obtain a required regulatory approval, Purchaser will be required to extend the Offer while waiting for the approval, rather than simply terminating the Offer.  

Because the parties generally negotiate a date after which neither party is obligated to proceed with the transaction  (the Outside Date), Purchaser likely will seek to limit any requirement to extend the Offer beyond that date.  The parties, however, may provide for an automatic (or optional) extension of the Outside Date when the Offer is extended.   

The parties, and particularly the Company, however, may wish to limit the length of the individual extensions that Purchaser is required to undertake if all conditions are not met.  The shorter period allows the parties to close the Offer more quickly once the relevant conditions have been met or waived, since after Purchaser has announced an extension it generally will not be able to shorten the extension.  The shorter period also provides increased flexibility to permit the Offer to be terminated promptly if it becomes clear one or more conditions will not be satisfied or waived.  

Impact of Competing Bids.  In addition, the Company may seek to include in Section 1.01(d) an option for the Company to require Purchaser to extend the Offer if a competing bid surfaces that the Company Board determines may constitute a Superior Proposal (see Section 5.02).  A Company option to extend could also be used in situations in which the parties agree to a "go-shop” that permits the Company to engage in additional efforts to actively seek competing bids in order to permit the Company Board to satisfy its duties under Revlon.  Alternatively, the Company may wish to have an option to extend to permit it to seek support for the Offer or to satisfy any conditions that may not be satisfied when the Offer otherwise could expire, so as to provide additional opportunity for the Offer to close.

Extension Mechanics

Rule 14e-1(d) under the Exchange Act provides that a tender offer may not be extended unless the bidder issues a notice of such extension by press release or other public announcement.  The notice must include disclosure of the approximate number of securities deposited and must be issued no later than the earlier of (i) 9:00 am Eastern time or (ii) if the securities subject to the tender offer are listed on one or more national securities exchanges, the first opening of any one of such exchanges, in each case on the next business day after the scheduled expiration date of the Offer.

Rule 14d-5(a) under the Exchange Act grants each shareholder the right to withdraw any securities tendered during the period the Offer remains open, except during a subsequent offering period.

Subsequent Offering Periods.  

Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act permits Purchaser to provide for a subsequent offering period if the initial offering period has expired and Purchaser has accepted all securities tendered during the initial offering period.   

Rule 14d-11 was adopted by the SEC in 1999 in part to "assist bidders in reaching the statutory state law minimum necessary to engage in a short-form, back-end merger with the target.”  Because Section 251(h) of the DGCL obviates the need to reach the high-threshold to utilize the short-form merger statutes, this Model Agreement (which is drafted to be governed by Section 251(h)) does not contemplate a subsequent offering period.  See generally Comment to Recitals.  

Nonetheless, should the parties desire a subsequent offering period (e.g., if the agreement is not governed by Section 251(h)), the following text may be included at the end of Section 1.01(d):  

"Purchaser may, and if requested by the Company Purchaser shall, make available one (1) or more "subsequent offering periods”, in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act, of not less than three (3) business days each and not more than twenty (20) business days in the aggregate for all subsequent offering periods.”

Under Rule 14d-11, during any subsequent offering period Purchaser must offer the same form and amount of consideration to security holders as it offered in the initial offering period and, if different forms of consideration were offered, there cannot be any ceiling on any form of consideration.

In addition, there are several procedural requirements associated with subsequent offering periods: 

•	Purchaser must announce the results of the Offer no later than 9:00 a.m. Eastern time on the next business day after the expiration date of the initial offering period and immediately begin the subsequent offering period.

•	During any subsequent offering period, Purchaser must immediately accept and promptly pay for all securities as they are tendered.  Consistent with requirement, stockholders do not have withdrawal rights for shares tendered in a subsequent offering period (see Rule 14d-7(a)(2)).

•	Each subsequent offering period must be of at least three business days, but may be longer.  [NTD:  Note prior SEC cap of 20 days, and reasons Target would want to limit]

1.01.(5).sec=	On the date of commencement of the Offer and after affording the Company and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon as described below in this Section 1.01(e), Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC, pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 14d-3 and Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer shall be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents”).  Parent and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act.  The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Purchaser all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents or reasonably requested by Parent and Purchaser for inclusion therein.

Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and to correct any material omissions therein; and each of Parent and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be disseminated to the Company’s stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws.

COMMENT:

Under Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer is commenced when the offeror has first published, sent or given the means to tender to security holders.  Depending on the facts and circumstances, adequate publication of a tender offer may require publication in a newspaper with a national circulation, publication in a newspaper with metropolitan or regional circulation or a combination thereof.  A tender offer for the stock of widely-held companies is typically commenced by publication in a newspaper such as the National Edition of The Wall Street Journal.  Under Rule 14d-3(a) under the Exchange Act, on the date of commencement as soon as practicable after commencement of the Offer, Purchaser must file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer.  [NTD:  Describe 14d-4 dissemination requirements as well.]  [NTD – CAN YOU ELABORATE, EXPLAIN FORM OF NEWSPAPER AD, WHEN COPIES NEED TO BE ACTUALLY MAILED, POSSIBILITY OF COMMENCING WITHOUT TOMBSTONE AD TO SAVE MONEY, ETC?]

(f)	Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel copies of any written comments, and shall inform the Company and its counsel of any oral comments or discussions, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from or engage with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments or the commencement or occurrence of any such discussions.  Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff and a reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff concerning such comments.  

Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or response (including the proposed final version thereof), and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company or its counsel.

COMMENT:

The Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed by Purchaser with respect to the Offer and its exhibits, including the Offer to Purchase, will be reviewed by the SEC staff in the Office of Mergers and Acquisitions.  Since a tender offer may be completed in as short as 20 business days, the comment process is typically handled by the staff on an expedited basis.  Comments may be given orally or in writing and may involve discussions with the staff on how to address particular disclosure issues.  

Responses to comments requiring changes to the Offer Documents are often addressed only by filing amended Offer Documents with the SEC, so that they’re available publicly on EDGAR, without distributing amended or supplemental Offer Documents directly to shareholders.  For some amended or supplemental disclosures, such as providing additional or materially revised financial statements, however, the staff requires distribution of the amended or supplemental material to shareholders and an extension of the offer period to permit dissemination of the material. 

(g)	If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the date on which any particular share of Company Common Stock is accepted for payment and paid pursuant to the Offer, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, then the Offer Price applicable to such share of Company Common Stock shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

COMMENT:

The purpose of Section 1.01(g) is to protect Purchaser from paying more than the bargained-for price for the Company.  The Offer Price is expressed as a per share price, based on an assumed number of shares.  If that number changes as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or similar action, the per share price automatically adjusts accordingly.  

(h)	On the terms set forth in this Agreement and subject only to the conditions set forth in Annex A, Purchaser shall accept for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly [after the expiration of the Offer,] as required by Rules 14d-11(e) and 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act.  The Offer Price payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash or immediately available funds.  Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase all shares of Company Common Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

COMMENT:

Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act requires Purchaser to pay the consideration offered promptly after termination of the Offer.  Payment is typically effected when Purchaser deposits the purchase price with the depositary for the Offer, such depositary having been appointed in the letter of transmittal by tendering shareholders as their agent for the purpose of receiving payments from Purchaser and transmitting such payments to them.  

While these rules do not specify the meaning of "promptly”, payment within the normal settlement period for securities trades, currently three trading days, should be considered to be prompt payment. 

(i)	Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled expiration thereof without the prior written consent of the Company, except in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII.  

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII prior to any scheduled expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer.  If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

COMMENT:

This paragraph requires Purchaser to keep the Offer open as long as the Agreement is not terminated.  However, it also requires Purchaser to terminate the Offer if the Agreement terminates.  Without this obligation, it would be possible for Purchaser to maintain its Offer notwithstanding that the Company Board has determined that the Agreement should be terminated, including to permit the Company to accept a Superior Proposal.  This obligation can be supported through the entry of a confidentiality agreement containing standstill provisions, such as those contained in the Model Confidentiality Agreement published in connection with the Model Merger Agreement.

1.02.(1).sec=	Subject to Section 5.02, the Company hereby consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the acquisition of Company Common Stock by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (collectively, the "Contemplated Transactions”).  [NTD:  Is this a seller-favorable definition?]

1.02.(2).sec=	Subject to Section 5.02(b), the Company shall 

(i) file with the SEC, on or as promptly as practicable after the filing by Parent of the Offer Documents, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Schedule 14D-9”), which Schedule 14D-9 shall (A) describe the recommendations referred to in Section ___ and (B) include the notice to holders of Company Common Stock of appraisal rights in connection with the Merger contemplated by Section 262, and 

(ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the holders of the Company Common Stock as and to the extent required by, and in conformity with, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and Section 262.  

Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Purchaser required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion therein.

Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and to correct any material omissions therein.  The Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company’s stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements.

COMMENT:

Section 1.02 describes the Company’s obligation to support the Offer.  This includes an affirmative obligation for the Company to prepare and file the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement required by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act describing the Company’s recommendation with respect to the Offer.

Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act requires the Company to publish, send or give to security holders, within 10 business days from the date the Offer is commenced, a statement that the Company recommends acceptance or rejection of the Offer, expresses no opinion and is remaining neutral toward the Offer or is unable to take a position with respect to the Offer.  

Rule 14d-9 specifies the content of that disclosure and the Company’s obligation to file it with the SEC.  While Rule 14d-9 would permit the Company to file as long as 10 business days after the filing by Parent of the Offer Documents, it is typical for the target in a negotiated transaction to agree to file its Schedule 14D-9 contemporaneously with Parent’s filing of its Schedule TO.

Section 1.02(b) requires the Company to make the recommendations described in Section ___, thereby requiring the Company to recommend acceptance of the Offer.  The Company’s consent to the Offer and its obligations to recommend the Offer are subject to the Company Board’s fiduciary duties.  Each of Section 1.02(a) and 1.02(b) is expressly made subject to Section 5.02(c), which addresses the ability of the Company Board to effect a Change in Recommendation.

Timing of Appraisal Rights and Related Disclosure.

Concomitant with the adoption of Section 251(h) of the DGCL, Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL was amended to allow the Schedule 14D-9 to serve as a notice of appraisal in connection with the merger.  If the Schedule 14D-9 is used as a notice of appraisal rights, target stockholders have until the later of the consummation of the tender offer and 20 days after the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 to demand appraisal rights.  This Section 1.02(b) of the Model Agreement requires that the target’s Schedule 14D-9 include the statutory notice of appraisal rights as contemplated by Section 262(d)(2).

Under Section 262(d)(2), a notice of appraisal rights must be sent to stockholders of record as of either (i) a record date determined by the target board, which date is no more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given or (ii) if no record date is fixed, the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.  Because the time between obtaining a definitive list of record holders of target stock and the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 may be greater than one day, a target board may consider setting a record date for stockholders entitled to receive the Schedule 14D-9 (if used as a notice of appraisal rights) at the time it approves the merger agreement (or, alternatively, delegate to a committee of the board the authority to set such a record date).   In light of this requirement, a buyer may seek (as reflected above) a covenant that the Schedule 14D-9 be disseminated not only in conformity with the Exchange Act, but also in conformity with Section 262 of the DGCL.

If the Schedule 14D-9 is not used as a notice of appraisal rights in a Section 251(h) merger, or if Section 251(h) otherwise is inapplicable, generally a notice of appraisal rights will be sent (i) by the target as part of a proxy statement in advance of a stockholder meeting pursuant to Section 262(d)(1) of the DGCL or (ii) by the acquiror through a separate notice of appraisal rights delivered after approval of the merger (either by written consent under Section 228 of the DGCL or by one of the short-form merger statutes) pursuant to Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. 

Penalties for Non-Compliance; Quasi-Appraisal.  Regardless of whether a Schedule 14D-9 or subsequent mailing is used as a notice of appraisal rights, it is vital, particular for the acquiror, that the disclosure complies with the Delaware appraisal statute and Delaware common law as to disclosures.  To the extent a Delaware court finds disclosure violations in the appraisal notice, a "quasi-appraisal” remedy may be appropriate, which would entitle all the stockholders who did not tender on the front-end (except those that opt-out) to the "fair value” of their shares as determined by the Court.  The Delaware Supreme Court detailed the "quasi-appraisal” remedy in connection with short-form mergers in Berger v. Pubco Corp., 976 A.2d 132 (Del. 2009).

Specifically, with respect to a post-Schedule 14D-9 notice of appraisal rights, the Delaware Court of Chancery explained in Gilliland v. Motorola, Inc., 859 A.2d 80, 86 (Del. Ch. 2004), that such a notice must include more than an "implicit reference to the ‘total mix’ of information disseminated in connection with a contemporaneously concluded tender offer.”  In other words, the Court suggested it is not enough for a post-Schedule 14D-9 notice of appraisal rights simply to refer to the Schedule 14D-9.  Instead, the Court held that "at a minimum, summary financial and trading data and reference to the publicly available sources from which more complete information is available” is required to be included.  

1.02.(3).sec=	The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel copies of any written comments and shall inform Parent and its counsel of any oral comments that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments.   

Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response (including the proposed final version thereof), and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent or its counsel.  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1.02, the obligations of the Company in the immediately preceding two (2) sentences shall not apply if the Company Board effects a Change in Recommendation or has formally determined to do so.

COMMENT:

Section 1.02(c) parallels Parent’s and Purchaser’s obligations to provide the Company and its counsel certain documents and information as set forth in Section 1.01(f) of this Agreement.

1.02.(4).sec=	In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Purchaser promptly with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Company Common Stock as of a recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings, computer files and all other information in the Company’s possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of the Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Purchaser such information and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in disseminating the Offer to the Company’s stockholders.  

Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, Parent and Purchaser shall hold in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement the information contained in any such labels, lists, listings, files and other information, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request of the Company, deliver (and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Representations to deliver) to the Company or destroy any and all copies and any extracts or summaries of such information then in their possession or control.

NTD:  NEED TO FORMAT IN LIGHT OF 251(H) AND GENERAL EXCLUSION OF TOP-UP OPTIONS IN DELAWARE DEALS; COMMENT SHOULD NOTE WHEN EVEN DELAWARE DEALS MIGHT RETAIN TOP-UP]

1.03.(1).sec=	Subject to Section 1.03(b) and Section 1.03(c), the Company grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option”), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.03, for so long as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof, to purchase from the Company that number of shares of the Company Common Stock equal to the number of shares of the Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of the Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of Parent at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share of the Company Common Stock more than 90% of the shares of the Company Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares of the Company Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option (such shares of the Company Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the "Top-Up Shares”).

COMMENT:

A top-up option permits a bidder in a tender offer to acquire ownership of 90% of the outstanding shares of the target’s stock (required to effect a "short-form” merger) even though it owns less than 90% after completion of the tender offer.  Because Section 251(h) generally eliminates the need to utilize a short-form merger in order quickly to cash out the stockholders who did not tender, merger agreements governed by Section 251(h) might omit the top-up option.  Nonetheless, top-up option provisions are included in this Agreement to provide example and discussion in the event an agreement is not governed by Section 251(h).  See generally Comment to Recitals.

1.03.(2).sec=	If (A) all of the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted) waived, and (B) at the time of the exercise of the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Shares when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly owned by the Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates, including those shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer as of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, including any applicable subsequent offering periods, would constitute no less than ninety (90%) percent of the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on such date, then Purchaser shall exercise the Top-Up Option.  

The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by Purchaser only during the two-business day period following the time at which shares of the Company Common Stock are first accepted pursuant to the Offer, or if any subsequent offering period is provided, during the two-business day period following the expiration date of such subsequent offering period; provided that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable:

(i) 	to the extent that the number of shares of the Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the number of authorized but unissued shares of the Company Common Stock that are not reserved or otherwise committed to be issued, 

(ii)	if any Legal Requirement or Order then in effect shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares, or 

(iii)	if Parent or Purchaser has not accepted for payment all shares of the Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn.  

The Top-Up Option shall automatically terminate upon the earlier to occur of (x) the Effective Time and (y) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII.

1.03.(3).sec=	The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Shares being purchased by Purchaser pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Shares by the Offer Price, without interest. Such purchase price may be paid by Purchaser, at its election, (A) entirely in cash, (B) by delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the purchase price or (C) partly in cash and partly by delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of the purchase price.

Any such promissory note shall be executed by both Parent and Purchaser, shall be full recourse against Parent and Purchaser, shall accrue simple interest at the rate of three percent (3%)2 per annum payable monthly, shall be payable upon the demand of the Company, may be prepaid without premium or penalty, shall provide that the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest under the promissory note shall immediately become due and payable in the event that (i) Parent or Purchaser fails to make any payment of interest on the promissory note as provided therein and such failure continues for a period of thirty (30) days or (ii) Parent or Purchaser files or has filed against it any petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors and shall have no other material terms.

COMMENT:

In considering the use of a top-up option, and in drafting language effecting one, a number of technical statutory and other issues must be considered:

Authorized But Unissued Shares.  In order for a top-up option to be effective, the target must have a sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares and treasury shares to permit the bidder to reach the 90% threshold.  The number needed can be significant, given that the shares issued in the top-up option increase both the numerator and denominator used to calculate the bidder’s percentage ownership; so that if the desired ownership is 90% then the target will need to issue 10 times the number of shares by which the tendered shares fell short of 90%.  For example, a bidder that acquires 80% of a target’s outstanding shares in a tender offer would need to purchase upon exercise of the top-up option a number of shares equal to 100% of all shares outstanding prior to exercise of the top-up option (10 times the 10% by which the offer fell short) in order to reach the 90% threshold.  

This mathematical reality may require the minimum tender condition to be fixed at a relatively high number well in excess of a majority of outstanding shares if the bidder wishes to avoid the target being required to hold a meeting of stockholders to effect a back end merger.  Most non-Section 251(h) merger agreements in connection with two-step transactions are drafted so that the tender or exchange offer will not close unless the top-up option will allow Purchaser to achieve the requisite threshold.  In fact, it would be unusual for the target corporation’s board to agree to a tender offer structure with a minimum tender condition that did not make it likely that Purchaser will be able promptly to close the back-end merger.  Such a scenario could well delay the closing of the second-step merger past the date a one-step merger could have been effected, and thus the parties might have preferred the one-step merger approach from the beginning.

Top-Up Option Threshold and Ownership Requirements

•	The minimum tender condition should be calculated on a fully-diluted basis, and a top-up option generally should not be available if the bidder owns less than such a majority of outstanding shares after expiration of the tender offer.  The top-up option is intended as a mechanism whereby a bidder that already has sufficient shares to cause the closing of a back-end merger may close more efficiently.  It is not intended to deliver control to a bidder whose offer is not compelling enough to achieve even a bare majority of shares.  If the minimum tender condition is fixed such that Purchaser owns less than a majority of shares, then fiduciary issues may arise in light of the fact that the merger would be effected with the support of less than a majority of the Company’s shares.  Consistent with this rationale for a target agreeing to grant a top-up option, the minimum tender condition for a company having a supermajority voting requirement for approval of mergers should be fixed at or above the required supermajority level.

•	Another reason to consider calculating the top-up threshold on a fully diluted basis is that, under Section 161 of the DGCL, the Company Board may cause the Company to issue shares that are unissued "or otherwise committed to be issued” (together with treasury shares, which Section 153 of the DGCL authorizes the Company Board to "dispose”).  It may be possible to "unreserve” shares to permit the use of a top-up, although care should be taken in considering any contractual requirements for making such a reservation.

•	A short form merger under Section 253 or Section 267 of the DGCL may only be effected if at least 90% of outstanding voting shares "is owned” by a single entity.  Accordingly, any target shares owned by Parent should be contributed to Purchaser before closing.  

•	Shares tendered by guaranteed delivery cannot be counted toward the 90% threshold until Purchaser actually acquires them, because those shares are not "owned” by Purchaser until then.  [NTD:  DESCRIBE GUARANTEED DELIVERY SHARES; CROSS-X TO NOTES IN CONDITIONS]

Terms for Valid Issuance of Top-Up Shares

•	Under Section 157 of the DGCL, the board of directors of the target corporation must approve by resolution "the terms upon which, … and the consideration … for which,” shares subject to the top-up option will be issued, and those terms must be "set forth or incorporated by reference in the instrument or instruments evidencing such [option.]”  The "instrument” can be the merger agreement itself.

•	Under Sections 152 and 153 of the DGCL, the board of directors of the target corporation must approve the amount of consideration for which shares are issued, which must at least equal the par value thereof, and the "form” and "manner” in which the consideration will be paid.  Accordingly, the target board must expressly authorize (i) the issuance of the maximum number of shares issuable under the top-up option, (ii) the per share exercise price payable therefor (which will be the offer price), (iii) the adequacy of the consideration payable for the top-up option and the shares subject to the top-up option, and (iv) the form of payment for the exercise of the option.  

•	With regard to payment, Section 152 permits shares of stock to be issued "for consideration consisting of cash, any tangible or intangible property or any benefit to the corporation, or any combination thereof.”  Accordingly, there is no need for a corporation to receive cash for any portion of the purchase price, including the par value thereof.  The entire purchase price for the top-up option may be paid by execution of a promissory note.  However, because the "form” and "manner” of payment must be approved by the board, the essential terms of the note (amount, interest rate, term, prepayment option or demand feature, and security, if any) should be set forth in the merger agreement, or a form of simple note appended thereto, and those terms should be reviewed and expressly approved by the target’s board in a resolution separate from the resolution approving the merger agreement.  Post-Closing the promissory note would become an obligation of the surviving company and should be eliminated.

•	The Delaware Court of Chancery provided guidance on validly structuring top-up options in Olson v. EV3, Inc., 2011 WL 704409 (Del. Ch. Feb. 2011), which discussed the issues described above.  Complying with these requirements will help the target corporation avoid litigation challenging the structure of the top-up option.

Other Considerations

•	Given that the top-up option is designed as a mechanical feature intended to facilitate the closing of a transaction by a bidder that already owns a majority of the target shares, the target may consider requiring the exercise of the top-up option, or possibly even making such exercise automatic, as provided in Section 2.03(b) above.  [NTD:  EXPLAIN LIKELY BUYER OBJECTION]

(d)	Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement may be exercised only once and shall not be assigned by Purchaser.  Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 1.03(d) shall be null and void.

(e)	If Purchaser exercises the Top-Up Option, Purchaser shall deliver to the Company written notice (the "Top-Up Notice”) setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up Shares that Purchaser intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which Purchaser intends to pay the applicable purchase price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up Shares by Purchaser is to take place.  The Top-Up Notice shall also include an undertaking signed by Parent and Purchaser that, promptly following such exercise of the Top-Up Option, Purchaser shall consummate the Merger in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by Section 6.05(b).  At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Parent and Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser the Top-Up Shares.

The parties hereto agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, including the payment for such shares, to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed received by the Company pursuant to Section 9.12, and if not so consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as possible.  The parties hereto further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by Section 6.05(b), subject to applicable Legal Requirements, as close in time as possible to (including, to the extent possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares. Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate to ensure that any issuance of the Top-Up Shares is accomplished in a manner consistent with all applicable Legal Requirements.

(f)	Parent and Purchaser understand that the Top-Up Shares will not be registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of Parent and Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company that Purchaser is, and will be upon any exercise of the Top-Up Option, an "accredited investor” as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.  Each of Parent and Purchaser represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.  Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares shall include any legends required by applicable Legal Requirements.

COMMENT:

NYSE/NASDAQ Requirements.  An additional issue for the exercise of a Top-Up Option is the possible application of stock exchange rules requiring shareholder approval for issuances in certain private transactions of common stock equal to 20% or more of the shares or voting power outstanding prior to such issuance at a price less than the greater of book or market value.  See NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635 and Section 312.03(c) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual .  

NYSE.  Subject to certain explicit exceptions, Section 312.03(c) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires shareholder approval of any issuance of shares of common stock (or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for common stock) if the number of shares issued in that transaction (or issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of the securities issued in that transaction) is equal to or greater than 20% of the total number of shares of common stock or voting power outstanding at the time of execution of the definitive agreement in relation to that issuance.  As applied to a  Top-Up Option, the NYSE believes that for a Top-Up Option to avoid the shareholder approval requirement of Section 312.03(c), the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the option must not be equal to or greater than 20% of the actually issued and outstanding common stock or voting power on the date the option is granted.  While Section 312.03(c) contains an exception for options sold in a bona fide private financing where the exercise price is at least as great as each of the book and market value of the issuer's common stock, that exception does not apply to the grant of a Top-Up Option because such a grant would not occur as part of a bona fide private financing.

Section 312.03(b) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual could also require shareholder approval for the grant of a Top-Up Option if Purchaser is a related party of the Company, including a director, officer or substantial security holder (i.e., holder of more than 5% of the common stock) of the Company and their respective affiliates.  

NASDAQ.  In general, NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(d) requires shareholder approval of the issuance of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) at a price less than the greater of book or market value that equals 20% or more of common stock or 20% or more of the voting power  outstanding before such issuance.  If the exercise price of the Top-Up Option is set at the tender offer price and the tender offer price is a premium to market, shareholder approval would not be required by the NASDAQ Listing Rule unless book value exceeds the tender offer price.  

This a different result than for the NYSE because NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(d) does not require that the option be granted in a bona fide private financing in order for the exception to the shareholder approval requirement to apply.

COMMENT:

The language in Section 1.03(g) is intended to address technical claims relating to the alleged adverse impact on valuation in an appraisal proceeding under Section 262 of the DGCL that have been raised in litigation challenging top-up options.  While Section 262(h) authorizes the Court to exclude "any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,” which should give the Court of Chancery sufficient latitude to ignore any adverse affect of the issuance of the top-up shares, the language in subsection (g) has become an accepted method to avoid such technical claims.  The target should also include similar language in its description of appraisal rights related to the back-end merger.

If Parent’s or Purchaser’s designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board, then, until the Effective Time, the Company Board, including such designees who are elected to the Company Board, shall take all such actions as shall be necessary or appropriate to assure that the Company Board shall have at least three directors who are directors on the date of this Agreement and who will be "independent” within the meaning of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, including applicable stock exchange requirements (the "Continuing Directors”); provided, that in such event, if the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below three for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Continuing Directors, if any, shall be entitled to designate persons to fill the vacancies in Continuing Director positions created by the reduction in the number of Continuing Directors and the persons so designated shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate three persons to fill the vacancies created by the reduction in the number of Continuing Directors, provided, that the persons so designated must be "independent” within the meaning of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and the applicable stock exchange requirements, and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement.

COMMENT:

Section 1.04 is intended to address the situation in which Purchaser closes the tender offer but is unable to quickly (within a business day or less) close the second-step merger.  

The most common source of delay, which is difficult to predict, is the failure to achieve the 90% threshold required to effect a short-form merger.  Because Section 251(h) of the DGCL obviates the need for a short-form merger, and requires the merger to be effected "as soon as practicable” following consummation of the Offer, drafters may consider omitting this Section 1.04 in merger agreements governed by Section 251(h).  Nonetheless, this Section 1.04 is included in this Model Agreement to provide example and discussion in the event an agreement is not governed by Section 251(h).  See generally Comment to Recitals.

Outside of agreements governed by Section 251(h), there will usually be some amount of delay between acceptance and payment for shares under the tender offer and the date the back-end merger can be completed.  For example, even though Purchaser has achieved its minimum tender condition of receiving tenders of a majority of the target company’s outstanding shares, or such greater percentage as may be required under applicable state law and the target company’s charter provisions to approve the back-end merger, if the 90% short-form threshold is not met, an information statement meeting the requirements of Section 14(c) of the Exchange Act and Regulation 14C thereunder, must be prepared and sent to the target stockholders at least 20 calendar days prior to the earliest date on which the merger may be completed.  During this period, unexpected complications resulting in further delay may arise.  An information statement is not required in the case of a short form merger since no stockholder vote is involved, but sufficient authorized but unissued shares may not be available for implementation of a top-up option that is adequate to reach the 90% ownership level that would permit a short form merger.

In view of the possibilities for delay in completing the merger and resultant exposures to unexpected developments and risks, Purchaser typically wants to have the ability to assume control of the target board of directors prior to completion of the merger.  On the other hand, because the change in directors will occur only in a scenario in which there will be a gap in time between the closing of the tender offer and the closing of the second-step merger, the target board will wish to maintain control over Purchaser’s obligations to effect the Closing and otherwise to enforce the Agreement, and to protect against transactions between the acquiror and the target company prior to completion of the back-end merger that the target company directors may believe are not in the best interests of the target company or its stockholders.  These competing considerations are typically accommodated by agreeing that Purchaser will have board representation generally proportionate to its ownership interest in the target.  The directors who remain on the target board following the change in composition are referred to as "Continuing Directors.”  

Section 1.04 also provides for continuing compliance with applicable stock exchange rules requiring independent director membership on a listed company’s audit and nominating committees.

1.04.(2).sec=	The Company’s obligations under this Section 1.04 shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.  Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, the Company shall take all action requested by Parent or Purchaser that is necessary to effect the election to the Company Board of any persons designated for election thereto by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.04(a), including dissemination of the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 to the Company’s stockholders.  In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly, at the option of Parent or Purchaser, either increase the authorized number of directors for the Company Board or use reasonable efforts to obtain the resignation of such number of its current directors as is necessary to enable Parent’s or Purchaser’s designees to be [elected or] appointed to the Company Board as provided above.  

At such time, the Company shall, if requested by Parent or Purchaser, take all action necessary to cause individuals designated by Parent or Purchaser to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the nearest whole number, on (A) each committee of the Company Board and (B) the board of directors of each Company Subsidiary (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Company Board, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, including applicable stock exchange requirements.  

Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, Parent and Purchaser shall take all action necessary to effect, and to assist the Company to effect, the [election or] appointment to the Company Board of those persons designated to serve as Continuing Directors pursuant to Section 1.04(a).

COMMENT:

Section 1.04(b) deals with the mechanics relating to the placement on the target corporation board of directors of the Parent or Purchaser is entitled to designate pursuant to Section 1.04 (a).

14f-1 Information Statement.  Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder require that specified information be provided to a company’s stockholders and filed with the SEC if persons who would constitute a majority of the company’s directors are to be elected or designated as directors of the company pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with the offeror in a tender offer.  The specified information, which includes information regarding the target company’s voting securities and principal stockholders, its directors and executive officers and their compensation specified in selected portions of Items 6, 7 and 8 of Schedule 14A (Rule 14a-101) under the Exchange Act, must be filed with the SEC and transmitted to all stockholders of record who would be entitled to vote at a meeting for election of the target company’s directors at least 10 days prior to the date any such person takes office as a director.  This may be accomplished through filing with the SEC and dissemination to the stockholders of a separate document, typically referred to as an information statement or schedule pursuant to Rule 14f-1, or by including the required information in the target company’s initial or an amended Schedule 14d-9 or Purchaser’s offer to purchase.  [NTD:  Note typical practice.]

In recognition of these federal requirements, Section 1.04(b) provides that the Company’s obligations to effect the election or appointment of Parent’s or Purchaser’s designees to the Company Board are subject to the requirements of Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder.  Reflecting the fact that compliance with Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 are, by their terms, obligations of the target company, Section 1.04 of the Model Agreement provides that the Company shall take all action requested by Parent or Purchaser that is necessary to comply with such requirements and further requires that Parent and Purchaser take all action necessary to assist the target company in doing so.

State Law and Fiduciary Issues.  On the state level, several issues are raised:

First, one method by which the change in board composition may be accomplished is by increasing the size of the board of directors.  However, the ability of the board to increase its size may be constrained by the corporation’s certificate of incorporation.

Second, achieving such a proportionate increase, even if permissible, could require the appointment of a large number of directors, which may be impractical.  The other method for achieving the agreed change in board composition is through resignation or removal of directors.  Under Delaware law, however, directors may not remove fellow directors, see 8 Del. C. § 141 (k), and directors also cannot be forced to resign and individual directors may believe their fiduciary duties in particular circumstances require them not to do so.

Several issues may arise when determining which incumbent directors should remain in office and which will be replaced by new nominees.  Whether management directors should remain is one consideration.  If an independent committee of directors negotiated the transaction, it is reasonable for the directors who served on the committee to remain to ensure the closing of the back-end transaction.  In addition, the impact removing certain incumbent directors would have on option grants should be considered to ensure that options do not accelerate too early and, conversely, to avoid unwanted option forfeiture upon directors’ resignations.  The terms of any option plan and whether any amendments may be needed in connection with the change in board composition should be carefully considered.

Another state law issue that may arise if Purchaser exercises its board control rights is the fact that the directors so chosen owe fiduciary duties to all stockholders, and not just to the person who nominated them.  While in many instances, the stockholders’ interests will be aligned, and the target corporation will be contractually bound to complete the merger, fact patterns may arise that would expose the new directors to claims of breach of fiduciary duty, either relating to the back-end merger or to business decisions involving potential conflicts of interest between the offeror in a tender offer or its affiliates and the target company.

For all these reasons, Purchaser may elect not to enforce its rights to board seats in the period between closing of the tender offer and closing of the second-step merger.

1.04.(3).sec=	Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any of Parent’s or Purchaser’s designees are [elected or] appointed to the Company Board prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required, in addition to the approvals by the Company Board or the stockholders of the Company that may be required by the Organizational Documents of the Company or applicable Legal Requirements, including applicable stock exchange requirements, for the Company to:

1.04.(3).(1).sec=	amend, modify or terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment, modification or termination of this Agreement;

1.04.(3).(2).sec=	extend the time of performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement, or to exercise or waive any of the Company’s rights, benefits or remedies hereunder;

1.04.(3).(3).sec=	except as expressly provided herein, amend any Organizational Document of the Company;

1.04.(3).(4).sec=	authorize or execute any Contract, or any amendment or modification of any Contract, between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates on the other hand, or the termination of any such Contract then in effect;

1.04.(3).(5).sec=	make any determination or give any approval or authorization that is required to be taken or given by the Company Board with respect to any action to be taken or not to be taken by or on behalf of the Company relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger; or;

1.04.(3).(6).sec=	take any other action or make any other determination of the Company Board under or in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions if such action would reasonably be expected adversely to affect the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than Parent or Purchaser).

The Continuing Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the Continuing Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company or the Company Board or counsel that is selected solely by the Continuing Directors) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as shall be determined by the Continuing Directors, and the authority (acting as a committee of the Company Board, which shall be deemed to have been duly constituted by the Company Board’s approval of this Agreement) to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce obligations arising under or in connection with this Agreement.

COMMENT:

Section 1.04(c) describes subjects on which the Continuing Directors will have separate rights to veto proposed target corporation actions or unilaterally to make determinations or initiate actions on behalf of the Company to protect the interests of target stockholders.  The enumerated subjects include actions relating to the Merger Agreement itself, with respect to which Purchaser remains on the "other side,” and actions that could change the rights of stockholders generally or involve self-dealing by Purchaser or its affiliates.

While there are good reasons to include such provisions, the use of Continuing Directors may be subject to an enforceability challenge.  In the context of poison pill rights plans, the Delaware Supreme Court has held that a continuing director provision operated as a "dead hand” provision putting certain portions of the management authority vested in the board as a whole in the hands of only certain directors elected by stockholders who no longer control the corporation.  A possible distinction from the poison pill cases is that Purchaser is the party whose rights to choose directors having full directorial rights have been arguably abrogated, and Purchaser has agreed contractually in advance to such restrictions.

In addition, Section 1.04(c) seeks to address this possible issue by providing that the Continuing Directors will be deemed to constitute a duly appointed Committee of the Company Board to which the authority of the Company Board has been duly delegated.

1.04.(4).sec=	Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any of Parent’s or Purchaser’s designees are [elected or] appointed to the Company Board, until the Effective Time, the Company Board, and each committee thereof, shall have at least such number of directors as may be required by applicable stock exchange rules or the federal securities laws who are considered independent directors within the meaning of such rules and laws ("Independent Directors”); provided, that after the Acceptance Time, subject to payment by Purchaser for all shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, the Company shall, upon Parent’s request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "Controlled Company” for purposes of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5615(c) (or any successor provision) and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status; provided, further, that if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below the number of directors that is required by such stock exchange rules or laws for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Directors shall be entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate such number of directors as may be required by applicable stock exchange rules or the federal securities laws, to fill such vacancies, which designees shall not be current or former Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or consultants of Parent, and such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.  

COMMENT:

Both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq have established corporate governance rules with which all listed companies must comply, subject to certain exceptions.  These corporate governance rules include requirements that a majority of a listed company’s board of directors consist of independent directors, as determined by the directors in accordance with the requirements of the corporate governance rules, and additional independent director requirements for certain key committees of a listed company’s board of directors.  Section 1.04(d) of the Model Agreement requires maintenance of compliance with these rules in the event Parent’s or Purchaser’s designees are [elected or] appointed to the Company Board.

Controlled Company Exemption.  The corporate governance rules of both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq include exceptions from some of their independent director requirements in the case of a "controlled company,” which term is defined as a company more than 50% of the voting power of which is held by an individual, a group or another company.  This definition would apply to the Company after Purchaser has accepted and paid for the Company’s shares tendered at or in excess of the minimum tender condition.  

Controlled companies are exempt from the general requirement that a listed company’s board of directors be comprised of [at least a majority of] [NTD:  is the threshold level missing?] independent directors and from the independent director requirements that would otherwise apply to a listed company’s compensation committee and nominating and governance committee.  The controlled company exemption, however, does not apply to the independent director requirements for audit committees of either the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq corporate governance rules.

ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

2.01.Ti=	The Merger.  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate existence of Purchaser shall cease.  Following the Effective Time, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation”).  The Merger will be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and be effected as soon as practicable after consummation of the Offer.

COMMENT:

This section addresses the technical mechanics of the second step merger.  

Form of Merger

Pursuant to Section 2.01, the merger sub will be merged with and into the target, with the target being the surviving corporation.  This type of merger involving a buyer, a subsidiary of the buyer and the target is known as a "reverse triangular merger.”  If the acquisition subsidiary, rather than the target, was the surviving corporation, the transaction would be referred to as a "forward triangular merger.”  

Another way in which to structure a merger is a direct, two-party transaction in which one party merges directly into the other.  There are several reasons why the parties might structure the second step transaction as a triangular rather than a direct merger: 

Contract Assignments.  By virtue of the target being the surviving corporation, the parties may be able to avoid potential issues relating to the assignment of contracts (including licenses) that might arise if the target were not the surviving corporation, although the relevant contract language (including any change of control provisions) must be examined to determine whether that is the case.  [But see Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC v. Roche Diagnostics GMBH, 2011 WL 1348438, at *12-13 (Del. Ch. Apr. 8, 2011) (on defendant’s motion to dismiss, court held that (i) plaintiff’s argument that a reverse triangular merger constituted an assignment "by operation of law,” as used in the anti-assignment clause at issue, was ambiguous)].  [NTD:  Update for 2013 decision, and/or cite similar issues from other jurisdictions, such as SQL.]

Buyer Stockholder Vote.  A triangular merger is frequently used, in part, so the buyer corporation will not be a "constituent corporation” for purposes of Section 251 of the DGCL.  If the buyer is a constituent corporation, the buyer would be required under Section 251 of the DGCL (if the buyer were a Delaware corporation) to obtain approval from the holders of its outstanding common stock (by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of its outstanding shares of common stock unless its certificate of incorporation sets forth some other applicable threshold), unless the buyer’s certificate of incorporation will not be changed and it will issue 20% or less of its outstanding common stock.  If buyer stockholder approval is required, the merger may also trigger appraisal rights for the holders of the buyer’s common stock.  By structuring the transaction as a triangular merger in which the buyer is not a constituent corporation, a vote under Section 251 (and the related possibility of appraisal rights) can be avoided.  

Note, however, that even if the buyer is not a constituent corporation, if the consideration in the transaction were stock and the buyer is issuing more than 20% of its outstanding stock, the buyer would be required to obtain the approval of its stockholders for the issuance of its shares under applicable New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq rules.  The vote required for the buyer to approve the share issuance in such a case is a majority of the shares voting on the proposal, rather that the higher standard of a majority of the outstanding shares that would be applicable in a direct merger.

Target Stockholder Vote.  This Agreement is drafted such that Section 251(h) of the DGCL, which obviates the need for a target stockholder vote if certain conditions are satisfied, governs.  See Comment to Recitals.  One such condition to the applicability of Section 251(h) is that the agreement of merger "expressly provides that such merger shall be governed by [Section 251(h)] and shall be effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the” tender offer.  The last sentence of Section 2.01 is drafted to satisfy this condition.

Corporate Separateness.  A buyer also generally prefers a triangular structure so that the target becomes a separate subsidiary of the buyer, and the buyer itself, as the holder of the target’s shares, does not become directly liable for the obligations of the target, subject to veil-piercing principles and to any assumptions or guarantees the buyer provides.  Maintenance of this corporate separateness may also be helpful where the buyer, for tax or other reasons, does not wish to engage directly in business in the jurisdictions in which the target operates.

Tax Considerations.  The decision to structure a transaction as a forward triangular merger rather than as a reverse triangular merger usually is driven by tax considerations, since ______.  [NTD:  explain]  

2.02.Ti=	Closing; Effective Time.  

The closing of the Merger (the "Closing”) shall take place at the offices of [PARENT’S COUNSEL, ADDRESS], at 10:00 a.m. local time on a date to be designated by Parent (the "Closing Date”), which shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Articles V and VI (other than those conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing) or at such other time and date as may be mutually agreed  by Parent and the Company.  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a Certificate of Merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger”) shall be duly executed by the Company and, as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of State”).  The Merger shall become effective upon the later of: (a) the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, or (b) such later date and time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger as agreed to by the Parties.  The date and time the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective Time.”

COMMENT:

Section 2.02, addressing the closing and the effective time of the second step merger, is the only contractual provision specifying the date and time for the closing of the second step merger and obligating the parties to consummate that merger and is therefore appropriately the subject of careful attention by the parties.  

Timing.  Because Section 251(h) obviates the need for a stockholder vote and requires, to be applicable, that the merger be effected as soon as practicable after consummation of the Offer, the closing would happen within days of (if not the same day as) the closing of the first step tender offer.  Similar timing would apply if Section 251(h) is inapplicable, but the buyer has obtained sufficient ownership to effect a short form merger.  If Section 251(h) is inapplicable and the buyer cannot effect a short form merger, the closing of the second step merger could not occur until after the requisite stockholder vote is obtained for the second step merger, as further discussed in Sections 6.03 and 6.04 and the Comments thereto.

Certificate of Merger/Certificate of Ownership and Merger.  Section 2.02 contemplates the filing of a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State by the target.  Instead of filing a certificate of merger, Delaware law also permits the filing of the merger agreement itself, although in most instances the surviving corporation chooses to file a certificate of merger.  

If Section 251(h) is inapplicable, either the target will file a certificate of merger under Section 251 (for a long-form merger) or purchaser will file a certificate of ownership and merger under Section 253 or Section 267 (for a short-form merger).  Accordingly, if Section 251(h) in inapplicable, this Section 2.02 should be amended to contemplate the possibility of filing either type of certificate as follows:  

"Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger or, if the Merger is effected pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL, a certificate of ownership and merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger”) shall be duly executed by the Company or Purchaser, as applicable, and, as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of State”).”

A certificate of merger must be executed in accordance with Section 103 of the DGCL, which requires, generally, that the certificate of merger be executed by an authorized officer of the filing corporation, which in the case of a long-form merger, is the Company as the surviving corporation.  A certificate of ownership and merger (i) if filed in connection with a short-form merger effected under Section 253 (e.g., where the purchaser is a corporation) must also be executed in accordance with Section 103 of the DGCL (which would require execution by an authorized officer of Purchaser) and (ii) if filed in connection with a short-form merger effected under Section 267 (e.g., where the purchaser is an alternative entity) must be executed in accordance with the purchaser’s governing documents and in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction under which the purchaser is formed or organized and filed in accordance with Section 103 of the DGCL.

In either case, under Delaware law, a merger is effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger or at such later time set forth therein, but such time cannot be later than a time on the 90th day after the filing date.  In order to take advantage of the flexibility afforded by Delaware law to have the effective time be up to 90 days after the filing of the certificate of merger, the merger agreement must provide, as does Section 1.3, that the merger will be effective upon the filing date or at such later time as specified in the certificate of merger.  If a later effective time is selected, the certificate of merger must include both the effective date and a specific time, such as follows:

That the merger of [Merger Sub] into [Company] shall be effective at 12:01 a.m. [Eastern] time, on [Date].

Multiple Jurisdictions.  If the constituent corporations are incorporated in two different jurisdictions, a filing must be made with the proper authorities in each jurisdiction in order to effectuate the merger.  In such circumstances, it may be advisable to provide in the certificates of merger, or other appropriate filings, for a specific future effective time of the merger, if both jurisdictions so permit.  By selecting a future effective time, the parties can avoid any issue that might arise if the effective time is different in each jurisdiction as may be the case if the filings provide that the merger is to be effective upon filing but the filing time is not coordinated in the different jurisdictions.

2.03.Ti=	Effect of the Merger.  

The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

COMMENT:

Under the applicable provisions of the DGCL, there are certain automatic consequences to a merger.  Pursuant to Section 259 of the DGCL, the separate existence of the constituent corporation that is not the surviving corporation ceases, and such constituent corporation is merged into the surviving corporation.  Upon the effectiveness of the merger, all of the property and liabilities of such constituent corporation are transferred to the surviving corporation as a matter of law.  In addition, all debts, liabilities and duties of such constituent corporation attach to the surviving corporation and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if such debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by it.  Although these consequences are automatic even without a provision like Section 2.03, many merger agreements contain this provision.

2.04.Ti=	Effect on Capital Stock.

2.04.(1).sec=	At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any other Person:

2.04.(1).(1).sec=	any shares of Company Common Stock then owned by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Company’s treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

2.04.(1).(2).sec=	any shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent, Purchaser or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

2.04.(1).(3).sec=	except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) above and subject to Sections 2.04(b), 2.04(c), and Section 2.07, each share of Company Common Stock then outstanding (other than Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, payable net to the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Legal Requirements in accordance with Section 2.06(e) upon surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares representing such Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.06(b) ; and

2.04.(1).(4).sec=	each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Purchaser then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

2.04.(2).sec=	If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction or event, or there occurs a record date with respect to any of the foregoing, then the Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted.

2.04.(3).sec=	At the Effective Time: (a) all holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Offer Price as contemplated by Section 2.04; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time.  If, after the Effective Time, any shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be cancelled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 2.06.

COMMENT:

Section 2.04 states the effect of the merger on the stock of the target and Merger Sub.  Under Section 251(b)(5) of the DGCL, a merger agreement must provide, and pursuant to Section 253 and Section 267 of the DGCL, the resolutions of Purchaser attached to the certificate of ownership and merger must provide, the manner of converting the shares of each of the constituent corporations into shares or other securities of the surviving corporation, or set forth the cash, property, rights or securities of any other corporation or entity which the holders of such shares are to receive in exchange for, or upon conversion of, such shares, which may be in lieu of or in addition to shares or other securities of the surviving corporation.  

In addition, Section 251(b)(5), Section 253 and Section 267 of the DGCL provide that shares of the constituent corporations may be cancelled in a merger, as provided in Sections 2.04(a)(i) and 2.04(a)(ii) of the Model Agreement with respect to the target’s common stock held by the target, any wholly owned subsidiary of the target, the buyer, the merger sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of the buyer.

Section 2.04(a)(iii) provides for the conversion of the target’s common stock into the "right to receive” the Offer Price, while Section 2.04(a)(iv) of the Model Agreement provides for the conversion of each share of the merger sub’s common stock into one share of common stock of the surviving corporation.  The phrase "right to receive” is generally used to describe any change of stock into something else, other than the conversion of stock of a constituent corporation into stock of the surviving corporation referred to in Section 2.04(a)(iv) of the Model Agreement, in order to comply with the requirements of Section 251(b) of the DGCL.  

Section 251(b) of the DGCL provides that the "manner of converting the shares of each of the constituent corporations into shares or other securities of the corporation surviving or resulting from the merger or consolidation…and, if any shares of any of the constituent corporations are not to be converted solely into shares or other securities of the surviving or resulting corporation, the cash, property, rights or securities of any other corporation or entity which the holder of such shares are to receive in exchange for, or upon conversion of such shares and the surrender of any certificates evidencing them, must be set forth in the merger agreement.”  Under Section 251(b) of the DGCL, when shares of a constituent corporation are to be converted solely into securities of the surviving corporation, the shares of such constituent corporation are automatically converted into such securities of the surviving corporation as a matter of law and without further action by the stockholders of the constituent corporation.  However, when the shares of a constituent corporation are to be converted into cash, property, rights or securities of another corporation (in this case, cash), Section 251(b) of the DGCL contemplates the surrender of the stock certificates representing the stock of such constituent corporation.  Section 253 and Section 267 of the DGCL make similar provisions for short-form mergers.  Accordingly, the merger agreements in such cases should provide that the shares of the constituent corporation are converted into the "right to receive” the merger consideration.

In order for Section 251(h) to be applicable, shares that were not tendered into the Offer and that are not otherwise to be cancelled must be converted into the right to receive the same amount and kind of consideration paid with respect to shares tendered in the Offer.  Accordingly, the amount and type of consideration in the second-step merger must be the same as the Offer Price.

[NOTE TO COMMITTEE: are we describing elsewhere why the price in the second step merger is the same as the Offer Price or should we be doing that here?  Seems like it should be covered in an intro of the overall deal structure.]  [NTD:  Good point – in the intro we’ll cover as part of the overall deal, but I would include here also to cover the 13e-3 exemption.]  

Appraisal Rights.  In the Model Agreement, the target stock is being converted into cash.  Thus, appraisal rights are available in the second step merger pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.  Section 2.07 of the Model Agreement provides an exception for shares held by stockholders who perfect their statutory appraisal rights.  Shares held by stockholders who perfect their statutory appraisal rights would not be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration unless and until such holders subsequently withdraw or lose such rights to appraisal.

Appraisal Rights in Stock Deals.  If the target stock were being converted solely into shares of the buyer’s stock and the back-end merger were effected under the "long-form” merger statute (Section 251(c)), there would be no appraisal rights because of the "market out” exception in Section 262 of the DGCL.  Section 262 provides that no appraisal rights shall be available for the stockholders of a constituent corporation in such a merger if 

(1)	on the record date of the stockholder meeting to approve the merger, the shares of the constituent corporation are (a) listed on a national securities exchange or (b) held of record by more than 2,000 holders, and 

(2)	such shares of the constituent corporation are converted solely into (i) shares of stock of the surviving corporation, (ii) shares of stock of any other corporation, which shares at the effective date of the merger will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, (iii) cash in lieu of fractional shares or (iv) any combination of (i), (ii) or (iii).  

	However, if the back-end merger were effected under Section 251(h) or the "short-form” merger statutes (Sections 253 or 267), appraisal rights would be available regardless of the whether the consideration were stock or cash.

Note, additionally, that even in a back-end long-form merger, it may not be clear whether appraisal rights will be available if the target is paying cash dividends to its stockholders in contemplation of a merger in which the target stockholders are receiving stock in the buyer.  The Delaware Court of Chancery has held that a dividend paid in connection with a stock for stock merger that otherwise would have satisfied the market out exception caused appraisal rights to be available where the dividend could only be paid if the acquiring corporation waived certain rights under the merger agreement.  Louisiana Mun. Police Employees’ Retirement Sys. v. Crawford, 918 A.2d 1172 (Del. Ch. 2007). 

Changes to Target Capital Structure.  Section 2.04(b) of the Model Agreement automatically provides for adjustments in the Offer Price, so that the value received by target’s stockholders is unaffected by changes in the target’s capital structure.  As is typical, the Model Agreement also contains a covenant that restricts the target’s ability to change its capital structure.  See Section [___] and related Comment.

2.05.Ti=	Treatment of Company Equity Awards and Company Stock Plans.  

2.05.(1).sec=	Treatment of Company Stock Options.  Each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and terminated without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Stock Option in consideration for the right at the Effective Time to receive a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price per share of Company Stock Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, less any amounts deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.06(e).  As of the Effective Time, all Company Stock Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Stock Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Stock Option Cash Payment in respect thereof.

2.05.(2).sec=	Treatment of Company Restricted Stock.  Each share of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, if not already vested on or before the Effective Time, automatically vest at the Effective Time and each such share of Company Restricted Stock shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Restricted Stock in consideration for the right at the Effective Time to receive a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the Offer Price, less any amounts deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.06(e).

2.05.(3).sec=	Treatment of Restricted Stock Units. Each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled without any action on the part of any holder of any Company RSU in consideration for the right at the Effective Time  to receive the Offer Price for each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU, whether or not otherwise vested as of the Effective Time, less any amounts deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.06(e).

2.05.(4).sec=	Treatment of ESPP.  The Company shall take all action that may be necessary to: (i) cause the offering period under the ESPP that is outstanding as of the date of this Agreement to be terminated as of the [fifth] business day prior to the Acceptance Time or the date such offering period terminates by its terms, if earlier (such date, the "Final Purchase Date”); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the ESPP; (iii) cause the exercise (as of the Final Purchase Date) of each outstanding purchase right under the ESPP; (iv) provide that no further offering period or purchase period shall commence under the ESPP after the date hereof subject to the occurrence of the Acceptance Time; and (v) ensure that no individual shall be permitted to make a new election to purchase shares in any current offering period or increase his or her election to purchase shares in any current offering period; provided, however, that the actions described in clauses "(i)” through "(iv)” of this sentence shall be conditioned upon the consummation of Offer. On such new exercise date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the ESPP.  Any shares of Company Common Stock acquired as a result of the completion of the Purchase Period that ends as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for purposes of Section 2.04(a)(iii).

2.05.(5).sec=	Further Action.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make any amendments to the terms of the Company Plans (other than the ESPP which is governed by Section 2.05(d)), and take any other actions, as are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by, and effect the provisions of, this Section 2.05.

2.05.(6).sec=	Payment for Equity Awards.  All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.05 (other than with respect to the ESPP, payments for which are governed by Section 2.05(d)) shall be paid to the holders of Company Equity Awards as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event on the earlier of the first payroll date on or after the Closing Date or the third (3rd) Business Day after the Closing Date, through the Company’s payroll system.

COMMENT:

Equity Awards.  The treatment of equity compensation awards is fact intensive, depending upon the provisions of the target’s existing plans and individual grants, as well as any agreements with optionees or grantees, including any employment or severance agreements that address the treatment of equity awards, and whether stock or cash is being used as merger consideration.  In two-step tender offers in particular, the existing plans, grants and agreements must be carefully reviewed to determine whether the closing of the first step tender offer or the closing of the second step merger triggers certain provisions, such as acceleration of vesting provisions.  

Often the treatment of equity awards is driven by such existing arrangements.  All such arrangements must be carefully reviewed to avoid unintended consequences.  See, for example, the history in AT&T Corp. vs. Lillis, 953 A.2d 241 (Del. 2008).  However, some targets may try to negotiate for accelerated vesting of all outstanding awards, even if not provided automatically under the target’s existing plans.  [NTD:  SHOULD WE NOTE WHETHER THERE ARE FIDUCIARY ISSUES IN SUGGESTING THAT OPTIONS BE ACCELERATED OR CASHED OUT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER VESTED?]  Some buyers may seek to assume existing awards and/or impose contractual modifications on the applicable agreements in connection with the merger, such as to avoid acceleration of vesting even if provided for under the target’s existing plans.

Section 2.05 generally requires that the board of directors of the target will take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the buyer’s requirements in Section 2.03(d), even if different from the target’s existing arrangements.  Target’s board and committee resolutions should specifically address the treatment of equity awards.  The buyer should confirm that the target’s board and compensation committee have taken all of the required actions.

Soliciting Consents from Equity Award Holders.  Note that attempts by the buyer to change existing arrangements to, for example, assume options and avoid acceleration of vesting, may require contractual consents from optionees, and in some circumstances may be construed as a tender offer for the options that needs to be analyzed separately from the two-step tender offer and merger itself.  While the buyer may want the award terms renegotiated, the actual renegotiation and agreement amendment would be effected by the target pre-closing, and therefore if potential tender offer treatment is an issue, it would be an issuer tender offer.  Consideration may be given to negotiating with select members of management to avoid tender offer issues.

[NOTE TO COMMITTEE: do we want to include all that we have in the model merger agreement regarding assumption of options just to explain what happens in the case options are assumed?]

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.  Restricted stock is stock that has actually been issued and is outstanding and would be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in connection with the closing.  Restricted stock units, however, represent an obligation of target to issue shares or cash payment equal to the value of a share upon certain terms and conditions.  If the merger itself causes the lapse of restrictions applicable to a restricted stock or restricted stock unit, nothing at all would need to be done, although as a precautionary matter the language providing for acceleration and lapse of restrictions would be included.  

As with the treatment of stock options, the buyer may want to negotiate to avoid acceleration of vesting.  In the Model Agreement, the merger consideration is cash so restricted stock and restricted stock units would be converted to cash, and the agreement could provide that the cash would be held in an escrow pending lapse of the forfeiture conditions (subject to the requirements of Code sections 409A, 457 and 457A, as applicable).  The buyer could elect to prorate the shares subject to the award; for example, with respect to target’s restricted stock units:

[For each Company RSU (or portion thereof) granted for which the applicable performance-period is complete as of the Effective Time, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU (or portion thereof) which shall vest for purposes of this Section 2.05(c), shall be determined based on actual performance in accordance with the terms and conditions of such award.  For each Company RSU (or portion thereof) granted for which the applicable performance period is not complete as of the Effective Time, the number of shares of Company Common Stock which shall vest for purposes of this Section 2.05(e), shall be equal to the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock that could be earned pursuant to such Company RSU, prorated based on the number of days in the performance period applicable to the Company RSU that have elapsed as of the Effective Time.  In the event that the Effective Time occurs following the completion of a performance period but prior to the Company’s certification of the achievement of performance goals for such period, the Company shall certify such achievement in a manner consistent with past practice.]

[NTD:  SHOULD WE COVER ABILITY OF OPTIONHOLDERS TO ENFORCE THESE PROVISIONS?]

2.06.Ti=	Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.  

2.06.(1).sec=	Paying Agent.  At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of the Offer Price to the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent”).  At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Offer Price to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement.  

Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available).  Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.  To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent, or the funds diminish for any reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the consideration contemplated by this Section 2.06, upon demand by the Paying Agent, Parent shall promptly reimburse any such loss so as to ensure that the funds are at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments contemplated by this Section 2.06.

2.06.(2).sec=	Procedures for Surrender.  As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the "Certificates”) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares”), in each case, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Offer Price at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement:

2.06.(2).(1).sec=	a letter of transmittal in customary form, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify, and

2.06.(2).(2).sec=	instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration.

Exchanges of any Book Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with the Paying Agent’s customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.  Upon surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the Offer Price for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share.  Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.  

If payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Offer Price to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.  Payment of the Offer Price with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.  

Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Offer Price in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon.

2.06.(3).sec=	Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares.  At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

2.06.(4).sec=	Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability.  At any time following six months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.06(b), without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with this Section 2.06(d).  Neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock for any Offer Price properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Law.

2.06.(5).sec=	Withholding Rights.  Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the relevant Common Offer Price, Preferred Offer Price, Merger Consideration, Warrant Payment or other consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Equity Awards or Company Warrants, as applicable, such amounts that Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Legal Requirements, including with respect to stock transfer Taxes payable by the seller. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

2.06.(6).sec=	Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such holder of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by the Paying Agent or Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent or Parent with respect to such Certificates, the Offer Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.04(a)(iii) hereof.

COMMENT:

Paying Agent.  Section 2.06(a) provides that the buyer shall select a "reputable bank or trust company” to act as the Paying Agent.  The target may also seek to provide that the Paying Agent be "reasonably acceptable to the Company” in the first sentence.  

Time for Distribution of Letters of Transmittal.  The target may wish to include in Section 2.06(b) an outside date by which a letter of transmittal must be mailed by beginning the first sentence: 

"As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than three business days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent will mail….”

The buyer (or the target’s transfer agent) may also seek a longer period of time to finalize the list of target stockholders at the closing to whom the letter of transmittal must be mailed.

[Termination of Exchange Fund.  In Section 2.06(d) the target may wish to require the Exchange Fund to remain in effect for a longer period, such as one year, instead of six month.]  [NTD:  IS THIS MUCH OF AN ISSUE?  IF SO, PLEASE EXPLAIN; OTHERWISE WE SHOULD PROBABLY DELETE.]

Application of Tax Withholdings.  In Section 2.06(e) the target may wish to provide that amounts withheld for tax payments be deposited with the relevant taxing authorities, by revising the last sentence as follows:  

"To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such withheld amounts shall be remitted by the Surviving Corporation to the applicable Taxing Authority and such amounts shall be treated ....”

2.07.Ti=	Appraisal Shares.  

2.07.(1).sec=	Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares ("Appraisal Shares”) of the Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.04(a)(iii), but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided in Section 262; provided, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.04(a)(iii).

2.07.(2).sec=	The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of the Company Common Stock.  The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

COMMENT:

While appraisal rights are not available in the Offer, they will be available in the merger pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL.  Section 2.07 of the Model Agreement provides an exception for shares held by stockholders who perfect their statutory appraisal rights.  Shares held by stockholders who perfect their statutory appraisal rights would not be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price unless and until such holders subsequently withdraw or lose such rights to appraisal.  Section 262 of the DGCL sets forth the requirements for perfecting appraisal rights.  

For more on technical and disclosure requirements with respect to appraisal rights, See Comment to Section 1.02 and Comment to Section 2.04.

[NTD:  NOTE POTENTIAL TIMING GAP BETWEEN OFFER AND MERGER AND IMPACT ON APPRAISALS]

2.08.Ti=	Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.  

At the Effective Time:

2.08.(1).sec=	the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended to read in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit A;

2.08.(2).sec=	the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated to conform to the bylaws of Purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

2.08.(3).sec=	the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors and officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time.

COMMENT:

Pursuant to Section 251(b) of the DGCL, a merger agreement must provide "such amendments or changes in the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation as are desired to be effected by the merger, or, if no such amendments or changes are desired, a statement that the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation shall be its certificate of incorporation.”  Section 251(b) of the DGCL does not permit the parties to simply select the certificate of incorporation of the non-surviving corporation to be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation -- it only provides for amendments to be made to the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation.  Accordingly, Section 2.08(a) of the Model Agreement provides for the certificate of incorporation of the Company to be amended in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit A.

Franchise Tax Implications.  In reverse triangular mergers, such as this merger, where the target will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the buyer, the certificate of incorporation of the target will often be amended to a "plain vanilla” form of certificate of incorporation for the surviving corporation with a minimum number of authorized shares of capital stock, so as to minimize Delaware annual franchise tax.  It is important to note that the annual franchise tax owed to the State of Delaware is based on the number of authorized shares in a corporation’s certificate of incorporation unless the corporation elects to calculate the annual franchise tax under the alternative permitted method, which is based on the amount of the total gross assets of the corporation and its authorized and issued shares.  8 Del. C. Section 503.  Accordingly, it may be advisable to amend the certificate of incorporation of the target in the merger to authorize the least amount of shares possible so as to incur the lowest possible franchise taxes for the surviving corporation.  Even if the target’s certificate of incorporation is not amended in the merger, because the surviving corporation will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the buyer following the effective time, amendments to the surviving corporation’s certificate of incorporation can be approved by the buyer as the sole stockholder of the surviving corporation following the effective time.

Changing of Directors and Officers.  Section 2.08(c) provides that the directors and officers of the merger sub immediately prior to the effective time will be the directors and officers of the surviving corporation after the effective time.  Although no provision of Section 251 of the DGCL specifically contemplates a merger agreement containing a provision to effect a change to the directors or officers of the surviving corporation, merger agreements often contain a provision similar to Section 2.08(c) of the Model Agreement.  Because Section 251 of the DGCL does not specifically authorize such changes to be effected pursuant to a merger, it may be advisable to have the buyer, as the sole stockholder of the surviving corporation, remove the directors then in office and elect the new directors immediately following the closing.  

If the target has a staggered board, the buyer may want to secure the resignations of the directors of the target, to the extent not already accomplished pursuant to Section 1.04 of the Model Agreement, because directors serving on staggered boards may only be removed for cause.  Alternatively, the buyer may want to amend the certificate of incorporation of the target to eliminate the staggered board at the effective time.  The buyer, as the sole stockholder of the surviving corporation following the effective time, can then act to remove the directors without cause.  

In addition, if the merger sub does not have a full slate of officers necessary to operate the surviving corporation, the board of directors of the surviving corporation should consider meeting, or executing a written consent in lieu of a meeting, promptly following the effective time, to appoint necessary officers. Alternatively, the merger agreement might provide that the officers of the target remain the officers of the surviving corporation.  

2.09.Ti=	Further Action.  

If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

COMMENT:

Following a merger various actions may be required, such as filings with registries of deeds with respect to properties owned by a constituent corporation to the merger.  It may be that the target’s name has been changed or the target does not survive in a forward triangular merger.  Section 2.09 makes clear that officers and directors of the buyer and the surviving corporation are authorized to take whatever actions, in the name of the target and the merger sub, that may be necessary to secure rights going forward after the merger.

ARTICLE 3

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser, except as set forth or incorporated by reference (a) in the Company SEC Reports or in the exhibits thereto, (b) in the part of the disclosure schedule delivered to Parent on the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule”) corresponding to the numbered section of this Article III that includes a particular representation or warranty, or (c) in any other part of the Company Disclosure Schedule where it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure or the context in which such disclosure is made that such disclosure should qualify a particular representation or warranty, as follows:

3.01.Ti=	Incorporation and Good Standing.

3.01.(1).sec=	The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are corporations or other entities duly incorporated or otherwise formed, validly existing, and in good standing (where such concept is recognized under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or formed) under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation or formation, with all necessary Entity power and authority to conduct their respective businesses as now being conducted and to own, lease or otherwise hold their respective properties and assets.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are duly qualified to do business as foreign corporations or other entities and are in good standing (where such concept is recognized under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction) under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the properties owned or used by them, or the nature of the activities conducted by them, requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.01.(2).sec=	Part 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each Subsidiary of the Company and sets forth as to each the type of entity and its jurisdiction of organization.  The Company has delivered or made available to Parent copies of the Organizational Documents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as currently in effect.

COMMENT:

The representation going to the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ incorporation and good standing is usually based on state corporate filings and typically is fairly non-controversial.  As a target’s draft, the language omits a representation as to due organization, the determination of which involves additional facts.

The determination that the target entities have all necessary Entity power and authority to conduct their respective businesses is made with respect to the entity purpose as stated in an applicable entity’s organizational documents and in consideration of any restrictions placed upon certain industries, such as banking or insurance, under specialized state statutes.  It is important for the target that the reference is limited to the entity’s power and authority; otherwise, the representation could have a much broader implication such as contractual or license authority.

The representation regarding qualification to do business as foreign corporations excepts failures to qualify that do not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  This is typically accepted by an acquirer given the relative ease in U.S. jurisdictions to cure failure of a foreign entity to qualify.

The listing of subsidiaries pursuant to the representation in paragraph (b) is typically something a public company will already maintain in connection with its securities filings.  Delivery of the organizational documents should normally be a straightforward, mechanical process unless a large number of subsidiaries or other factors make the delivery of documents difficult.

3.02.Ti=	Authority; No Conflict.  

3.02.(1).sec=	Assuming the accuracy of the representation in Section 4.06 hereof, (i) the Company has all necessary Entity power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, and (ii) the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Contemplated Transactions, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. The Company Board has by resolutions duly adopted:

(i)	determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company’s stockholders, 

(ii)	approved in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company, 

(iii)	declared that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable, and 

(iv)	resolved to recommend that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock to Purchaser in the Offer and to the extent necessary adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement ("Company Board Recommendation”). 

The Company has duly executed and delivered this Agreement.  Assuming the accuracy of the representation in Section 4.06 hereof, this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Legal Requirement affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and to general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding whether in equity or at law).

3.02.(2).sec=	Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions, will, except as have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect:

(i)	contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of (x) assuming the accuracy of the representation in Section 4.06 hereof, any Legal Requirement or any Order to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, assuming that all filings and notifications in accordance with the HSR Act and the filing of the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL have been made; (y) the provisions of any Material Contract or any material Governmental Authorization of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (z) the provisions of any of the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or 

(ii)	result in the creation of any Encumbrance (other than a Permitted Lien) upon or with respect to any of the assets of any of the Target Companies.

3.02.(3).sec=	To the Knowledge of the Company, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions by the Company will not, require any Consent of, or filing with or notification to, any Person, except:

Stockholder Vote Requirement.  Section 3.02(a) addresses the target’s authority to undertake the tender offer and merger transactions.  

•	If Section 251(h) is applicable to the merger agreement, no stockholder vote is required to adopt the agreement.  One condition to the applicability of Section 251(h) – that neither Parent nor Purchaser is an "interested stockholder” of target (as defined in Section 203(c) of the DGCL) at the time the target board has approved the merger agreement – is outside the control of target.  Accordingly, an assumption is included in this representation that the buyer’s representation as to its ownership of target stock is accurate.  

•	If Section 251(h) does not apply, the representation in the first and third sentence of Section 3.02(a) should be qualified by reference to obtaining the required stockholder vote.  

Delaware Section 203.  Even if Section 251(h) were inapplicable, in determining both the requisite vote to approve the agreement in connection with Section 3.02(a), and whether the transaction could contravene the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law in connection with Section 3.02(b), the target will need to consider whether Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar state antitakeover statute in the target’s state of incorporation) applies, or whether the target has opted out of the takeover protections of Section 203 in its certificate of incorporation.  Section 203 generally provides that an acquirer of greater than 15% of a target’s stock (an "interested stockholder”) must wait three years before it can merge with the target unless: 

(i)	the board has approved the merger in advance of the stockholder’s acquisition of greater than 15% of the target’s stock, 

(ii)	the stockholder acquired 85% or more of the target’s stock (and did not previously hold an amount of target stock between 15% and 85%), or 

(iii)	the merger is approved by at least 66 2/3% of the shares not held by the interested stockholder.  

If the target has not opted out of Section 203, it should consider whether to (i) get representations from the buyer confirming that the buyer is not already an interested stockholder (See Section 4.06) and (ii) qualify its representations as to the requisite vote to adopt the agreement and as to no violation of law with an assumption that such buyer’s representation is correct.  The target also may want to consider whether advance action of the target board would be required to avoid the applicability of Section 203.  [NTD:  Move into/coordinate with Sec. 3.22 anti-takeover discussion.] [NTD:  LET’S LEAVE THIS HERE, SINCE MOST TARGETS WILL NEED TO SAY SOMETHING IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT.]

A buyer may additionally request the seller represent that its Board has determined that the transaction is advisable.  A Board recommendation of the transaction is significant because of both the tender offer regulatory requirements of a Board to disclose its recommendation or lack of position regarding the tender offer under Exchange Act Rule 14e-2 and the process of a Board referring a merger to stockholder vote under Sections 251(b) and (c) of the DGCL.  [NTD:   consider whether to start with a rep as to the Board’s conclusion of advisability]  [NTD:  I THINK WE NEED TO ADD INTO THE TEXT HERE REPS RE THE BOARD’S APPROVAL, ETC.  GIVEN 251(B), IT’S HARD NOT TO START WITH ADVISABILITY, BUT WE CAN INCLUDE A REFERENCE TO 146]  To protect Board discretion to change its recommendation regarding a transaction, the target may want to limit any such representation regarding Board determination to the date of the agreement.  [NTD:  Add buyer request for rep that Board has determined transaction to be "fair to and in best interests of” Company.]

The representation in Section 3.03(c) regarding required consents for consummation of the transaction is qualified by the target’s knowledge, reflecting that the target does not have all information necessary to determine what consents will be required.

3.03.(2).(10).sec=	[•] shares of Company Preferred Stock are reserved for issuance upon exercise of the [•] rights issued pursuant to the rights agreement dated [•] between the Company and [•] (the "Company Rights Agreement”).

3.03.(3).sec=	There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness or, except for the Company Common Stock, other securities of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote.

3.03.(4).sec=	Part 3.03(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date hereof, a complete and correct list of each Contract (other than Company Stock Plans) obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, or securities convertible into equity interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or that give any Person the right to receive any economic benefit or right similar or derived from the economic benefits and rights accruing to holders of equity interests in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Company Stock-Based Right”), setting forth with respect to each such Company Stock-Based Right:  the name of the holder thereof; the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock-Based Right; and the per-share price at which such Company Stock-Based Right may be exercised.

3.03.(6).sec=	Each outstanding share of capital stock of each of the Company’s Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and each such share owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Liens.

COMMENT:

A target should ensure that its capitalization representations are dated because of the potential for capitalization numbers to change between signing and closing.  A buyer will most likely require these numbers be brought down at closing.  [NTD:  Note potential need to provide a capitalization date prior to the date of the agreement, and the buyer’s likely request for a bridging representation.]

Depending on the magnitude of equity incentive issuances, the level of holder-by-holder disclosure in Section 3.03(d) may be overly burdensome to the target; however, buyers should use all available means to confirm target’s commitments with respect to target’s capital stock.  The target should consider what is a reasonable format for providing equity incentive disclosure and tailor the representation accordingly.

3.04.Ti=	SEC Reports.  

3.04.(1).sec=	The Company has filed on a timely basis since [•] (the "Applicable Date”) all forms, reports and other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC (the "Company SEC Documents”).  True and correct copies of all Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, whether or not required under applicable laws, have been furnished or made available to Parent or are publicly available in the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) database of the SEC.

3.04.(2).sec=	No subsidiary of the Company is, or since the Applicable Date has been, required to file any form, report or other document with the SEC.

3.04.(3).sec=	As of the time it was filed or will be filed (as the case may be) with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a filing, then on the date of such filing):  

(i)	each of the Company SEC Documents complied or will comply (as the case may be) in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (as the case may be), and with all applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, each as in effect on the date such Company SEC Document was, or will be, filed; and 

(ii)	none of the Company SEC Documents contained or will contain (as the case may be) any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit (as the case may be) to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

3.04.(4).sec=	The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures that; 

(i)	require the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, 

(ii)	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the Board of Directors of the Company and 

(iii)	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries that could have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

3.04.(5).sec=	The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), designed to ensure that 

(i)	all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and 

(ii)	all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

COMMENT:

The buyer of a public company target will rely on the target’s securities disclosures for a large portion of its due diligence.  The representations in Section 3.04 creates the tie between the public company filings and the buyer’s reliance on them.

It is possible the buyer will request additional representations, such as regarding timely Section 16 filings by the target’s directors and officers, compliance with the applicable exchange rules and disclosure of exchange correspondence, and additional detail regarding internal controls over financial reporting.

3.05.Ti=	Financial Statements.  

3.05.(1).sec=	The financial statements (including any related notes) contained in the Company SEC Documents fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC, and except that unaudited financial statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to year-end adjustments).  The consolidated balance sheet included in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K is referred to herein as the "Company Balance Sheet.”  No financial statements of any Person other than the Subsidiaries of the Company are, or, since the Applicable Date have been, required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

3.05.(2).sec=	Part 3.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, and the Company has delivered to Parent complete and correct copies of, the documents creating or governing all of the Company’s Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

COMMENT:

The financial statement representations further connect the merger agreement with the target’s public company disclosures.  The representation in 3.05(a) contains GAAP and materiality qualifiers that make the representation less stringent than the requirements under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are likely to be resisted by a buyer.

3.06.Ti=	No Undisclosed Liabilities.  

As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has not had any liabilities of the type required to be disclosed in the liabilities column of a consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for:  (a) liabilities disclosed in the financial statements (including any related notes) contained in the Company SEC Documents; (b) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; (c) liabilities arising under the Material Contracts; (d) liabilities that have not had a Company Material Adverse Effect; and (e) liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger.

COMMENT:

As a target draft, the no undisclosed liabilities representative has been limited by dating, qualification to GAAP requirements, and the exceptions of clauses (a) through (e).  Another alternative for a target might be to eliminate this representation in full from an initial draft.  A buyer is likely to argue strongly for removal of the GAAP qualification, with the comment that otherwise the representation is not significantly different from the financial statements representation.

3.07.Ti=	Absence of Certain Changes and Events.  

Between the date of the Company Balance Sheet and the date of this Agreement, 

(a)	the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and 

(b)	neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has: (i) had any Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) amended its Organizational Documents; (iii) incurred any indebtedness for borrowed money or guaranteed any such indebtedness, except in the ordinary course of business; (iv) changed, in any material respect, its accounting methods, principles or practices except as required by changes in GAAP; (v) sold or otherwise transferred any material portion of its assets, except for sales of equipment and inventory in the ordinary course of business; (vi) declared, set aside or paid any dividend with respect to the outstanding Company Common Stock; (vii) acquired any equity interest or voting interest in any Entity (other than a Subsidiary); or (viii) entered into any agreement to take any of the actions referred to in clauses (ii) through (viii) of this sentence.

COMMENT:

The absence of certain changes representation covers the period since the target’s last audited balance sheet, or to limit the representation further, the target may want to limit the representation from the date of its last publicly filed balance sheet.  A buyer will typically want to integrate into this representation the full list of events that would require the buyer’s consent under Section 5.01 of this Agreement.

3.08.Ti=	Intellectual Property; Privacy.  

3.08.(1).sec=	Part 3.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and correct list as of the date of this Agreement of all U.S., state and foreign:  (i) Patents owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) Registered Trademarks owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (iii) Registered Copyrights and material unregistered Copyrights owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

3.08.(3).sec=	The Company and its Subsidiaries are the sole and exclusive beneficial owners, and, with respect to applications and registrations, record owners, of all the Owned Company IP.

3.08.(4).sec=	The Owned Company IP and Licensed Company IP constitute all the Intellectual Property necessary to conduct the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

3.08.(5).sec=	The Owned Company IP and, to the Knowledge of the Company, Licensed Company IP, are valid, subsisting and enforceable.

3.08.(6).sec=	No Owned Company IP or Licensed Company IP is being licensed, enforced or otherwise used in a manner that would result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of such Intellectual Property.

3.08.(7).sec=	Use by the Company and its Subsidiaries of any Company IP, and the conduct of their respective businesses, does not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any rights of any person, and no proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, has been threatened or asserted against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with regard to the ownership, use, infringement, misappropriation, violation, validity or enforceability of any Company IP.

3.08.(8).sec=	Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property of any Third Party.

3.08.(9).sec=	To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person is infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating any rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in or to any Company IP.  No Proceeding is pending or has been threatened or asserted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries against any person with regard to the ownership, use, infringement, misappropriation, violation, validity or enforceability of any Company IP.

3.08.(10).sec=	The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable actions to protect the confidentiality of their Trade Secrets and other confidential information.

3.08.(11).sec=	The consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, and compliance by the Company with the provisions of this Agreement, will not result in the termination, cancellation, loss, or impairment of, nor require the payment of additional amounts or the consent of any Person in respect of, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance in or upon, any Company IP.

3.08.(12).sec=	Section 3.08(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains each Privacy Policy in effect at any time and identifies, with respect to each Privacy Policy, (i) the period of time during which such privacy policy was or has been in effect, (ii) whether the terms of a later Privacy Policy apply to the data or information collected under such privacy policy, and (iii) if applicable, the mechanism (such as opt-in, opt-out, or notice only) used to apply a later Privacy Policy to data or information previously collected under such privacy policy.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries either has or had any electronic or other database containing (in whole or in part) Personal Data or User Data.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied at all times and in all material respects with all of the Privacy Policies and with all applicable Legal Requirements pertaining to privacy (including the obtaining, storing, using or transmitting of User Data), User Data or Personal Data.  Neither the execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement (or any of the Ancillary Agreements) nor the consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions, nor the Parent’s possession or use of User Data, will result in any violation of any Privacy Policy or any applicable Legal Requirement pertaining to privacy, User Data or Personal Data.

3.09.Ti=	Property; Sufficiency of Assets.  

The Company and its Subsidiaries (i) have good, valid and, in the case of real property, marketable title to, or valid leasehold or sublease interests or other comparable contract rights in or relating to, all of the real property and other tangible assets used in or necessary for the conduct of their business as currently conducted, including good and valid title to all real property and other tangible assets reflected in the latest audited financial statements included in the Company SEC Reports as being owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries or acquired after the date thereof (other than property sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the date thereof), free and clear of all Encumbrances, except for

(C)	Encumbrances incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices in connection with workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance and other types of social security or to secure the performance of tenders, statutory obligations, surety and appeal bonds, bids, leases, government contracts, performance and return of money bonds and similar obligations and

All material items of equipment and other tangible assets owned by or leased to the Company and its Subsidiaries are sufficient for the uses to which they are being put, are in good and safe condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and are sufficient for the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the manner in which such business is currently being conducted.  Part 3.09 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all material real property and any material interest in real property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Rule 14d-10 "Best Price Rule” Representation.

[Sub-sections (t), (u) and (v) above address the seller’s compliance with the SEC’s "best price” rule.  

Exchange Act Rule 14d-10 includes the "best price rule,” which requires that consideration paid to each security holder tendering in a tender offer be the highest consideration paid to any other security holder for their tendered securities.  The consequences of a violation of the rule can be quite high; every stockholder potentially could claim the difference between what the stockholder received and what the favored stockholder received.  For example, if an executive received payment ostensibly as a closing bonus that was deemed under the rule to be consideration for his or her shares, then all stockholders potentially would have a claim to the same additional per-share consideration for all of their shares.  With that leverage, even a small payment in violation of the rule could lead to large damages, particularly if the recipient owned relatively few shares.  

A series of cases largely in the years 1995 through 2003 found violations of the rule arising from payments under compensation or severance arrangements triggered by the tender offer (see, e.g., Gerber v. Computer Assoc., 303 F.3d 126, 136 (2d Cir. 2002) (portion of confidentiality agreement payment to Chairman and CEO of target company determined to be payment for his tendered shares); Epstein v. MCA, Inc., 50 F.3d 644, 655 (9th Cir. 1995) (finding a Capital Contribution and Loan Agreement with the target company’s Chairman and CEO to violate Rule 14d-10)).  Given this uncertainly, and the potentially large damages, use of the tender offer became very limited, with parties opting to use a one-step merger, in which the best price rule does not apply (see Amendments to the Tender Offer Best-Price Rules, Exchange Act Release No. 54,684 (Dec. 8, 2006)).  

To reduce uncertainty around the best price rule, the SEC amended it in 2006 to clarify that the rule only applies to the consideration for securities tendered in the tender offer.  The amended rule:

•	specifies that the consideration subject to best price requirements is the "consideration paid to any security holder for securities tendered in the tender offer” rather than consideration paid to a security holder "pursuant to the tender offer,”

•	provides that the best price provisions do not prohibit negotiation, execution or amendment of compensatory arrangements, and

•	contains a non-exclusive safe harbor for certain compensatory arrangements approved as compensatory arrangements by the compensation committee of the target company or the bidder, as applicable.

The amended rule, including the certainty of the safe harbor has had the intended effect of reinstating the tender offer as a viable transaction structure in many instances, evidenced by an increase in the number of tender offers and by the absence of new court decisions finding violation of the best price rule.

Non-Compensatory Arrangements.

While the Instruction to paragraph (d) of Rule 14d-10 states that the express references to employment compensation, severance and other employee benefit arrangements as exclusions from best price restrictions do not preclude the ability to enter into commercial or other arrangements with tendering security holders under the best price rule, the absence of safe harbors for these other arrangements means that a bidder must assess the risk of argument that a commercial or other agreement completed in connection with a tender offer is actually a premium for securities tendered by the other party to the arrangement.  Additional risk also potentially arises from an argument that the arrangement effectively constitutes a purchase outside the tender offer, which is prohibited under Exchange Act Rule 14e-5.  Third party valuations for fairness or market price in connection with commercial or other arrangements involving a security holder may help mitigate these risks.  

Given the text of the amended rule, and its applicability to securities tendered, an agreement not to tender by a stockholder that is also party to a commercial or other arrangement being completed around the time of the tender offer may provide additional protection against a Rule 14d-10 challenge.

In the private equity context, this type of Non-Tender and Support Agreement has been utilized with management of the target that will be receiving rollover equity in the acquiror.  These management representatives enter into the agreement before the launch of the tender offer, refrain from tendering in the tender offer, commit to vote in support of the second-step merger if a vote is required, and receive their roll over equity as consideration in the merger.  

Compensatory Arrangements and Safe Harbor

The best price rule is not violated by employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangements where the amounts payable thereunder are: 

•	being paid for past services performed, future services to be performed, or future services to be refrained from performing, by the security holder*; and

•	not calculated based on the number of securities tendered or to be tendered* in the tender offer.  

Rule 14d-10(2) provides a non-exclusive safe harbor, under which the requirements noted above for not violating the best price rule will be deemed to have been met.  The safe harbor arises if an arrangement is approved as an employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement solely by independent directors of the subject company (regardless of whether it is party to the arrangement) or, if the arrangement will be with the bidder, by independent directors of the bidder.  Under Rule 14d-10(d)(2), the body of independent directors to approve the compensation arrangements is typically the compensation committee, and the discussion below refers to the compensation committee, but the Rule should be consulted for additional detail.  

In the Agreement, a bidder will typically seek confirmation of the satisfaction of the safe harbor in a representation, a covenant, or both.  This Agreement contains both a representation and a covenant (see Section 6.10), although if the target is not prepared to give a representation at the time of signing (which could be the case of the compensation committee has not had the opportunity to review and approve compensation arrangements under Rule 14d-10), the target should negotiate for having a prospective covenant only.  

From a bidder perspective, whether the provision is contained in a representation, covenant, or both is likely to be less significant than ensuring that its closing conditions require that the Compensation Committee of the target has acted consistently with the Rule 14d-10 safe harbor prior to the closing of the tender offer.  For the bidder, this condition would need to apply with respect to all compensation arrangements that could be called into question in a tender offer, with no material adverse effect carveout or other limitation, particularly given that protection of the safe harbor would depend on strict compliance with the provisions of the rule.  The bidder may also want a right to terminate if the target cannot satisfy the Rule 14d-10 safe harbor.

A 14d-10 representation or covenant is likely to address the following:

Arrangements being Approved as Employment Compensation, Severance or other Employee Benefit Arrangement.  In making its representations and covenants, a target will want to limit the employment arrangements being covered, both to avoid the risk of any potential liability from inadvertently including arrangements not considered by the compensation committee and to establish a clear set of arrangements being presented to the compensation committee for approval.  If the description of the agreements being reviewed by the compensation committee were overly broad, as a corporate law matter there could be questions raised as to the validity of the compensation committee’s action under its due care obligations.  

Length of Lookback.  In the representation as drafted above, there is description of the arrangements being considered and a time frame limitation of the past 18 months.  An 18-month lookback may be broader than what is necessary to give comfort that arrangements were not related to the tender offer (or there could be contexts where it is too narrow), and the assessment of the appropriate time period would have to be made in the context of the specific facts and the history of target and management consideration of a tender offer or other change of control.  Although the target will want to limit the set of arrangements being approved, it is also of interest of all parties to be certain that all applicable arrangements are addressed to have safe harbor coverage.

Breadth of Arrangements Covered.  The representation above covers any employment agreement, severance agreement or change of control agreement and any Company Options or Restricted Stock awarded or accelerated  Some buyers may ask for more, noting that they want comfort over any payments being made to relevant securities holders.  See Comment above on Non-Compensatory Arrangements.  For example, a bidder may request that the representation also cover:

"Any other arrangement with any holder of Shares who was or is a director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that may reasonably be considered to be conditional on, related to or otherwise an integral part of the Offer or Merger.”

The Company may object to such expansion on the grounds that ____________.  [NTD:  Need to fill this out.]

Arrangements with the Bidder.  The Rule 14d-10 safe harbor allows the target’s Compensation Committee to approve arrangements that tendering equity holders are making with parties other than the target, such as arrangements with the bidder.  The target may in this instance wish to push for the bidder’s compensation committee to approve arrangements with the bidder or its affiliates because the bidder will have better information about such arrangements and their intent.  If it is successful in having the bidder’s compensation committee act, the target may wish to obtain a representation from the bidder of its compliance with the Rule 14d-10 safe harbor.  If the target’s compensation committee is approving arrangements with other parties, the target will want to maintain rights to receive all information related to such an arrangement that it needs to determine its approval, and the target may want a representation as to the completeness and accuracy of such information.

Buyers may ask for additional coverage, such as:  ___________________

Director Independence.  A Board determination of the independence of the directors approving the arrangement satisfies the 14d-10 safe harbor independence requirements.  The requirements regarding director independence generally follow listing standards of the applicable exchange.  The representation above requires the determination of independence not only at the time of the Agreement’s signing and closing but also as of the periods in which the arrangements were entered, which would be important if parties were relying on previous compensation committee actions.

3.23.Ti=	Opinion of Financial Advisor.  

The Company’s board of directors has received the opinion of [•]dated •, to the effect that, as of such date, and based on the assumptions, qualifications and limitations contained therein, the consideration to be received by the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to such stockholders from a financial point of view.  

[NTD:  Comment below is from Model Merger Agreement]

COMMENT:

Prior to recommending a merger agreement for stockholder action, a board of a Delaware corporation must determine that the merger agreement is advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders.  DGCL, Sec. 251(b).  The directors’ fiduciary duty of due care requires that the board act in an informed and deliberate manner in determining whether to approve or disapprove the merger agreement.  Indeed, the Delaware Supreme Court has indicated that a board cannot simply "abdicate” and turn the decision as to whether to merge over to the stockholders.  "[A] director may not abdicate that duty by leaving to the stockholders alone the decision to approve or disapprove the agreement.”  Smith v. Van Gorkom, 488 A.2d 858, 873 (Del. 1985).  

Part of the directors’ duty of care obligation is to make an informed business judgment as to the financial fairness of the consideration to be received by the corporation’s stockholders in the merger.  In Van Gorkom, the Delaware Supreme Court cited the failure of a board to have sought or received a fairness opinion in connection with its approval of a merger agreement as evidence that the board had breached its duty of care in approving the merger agreement.  While the court did not state that a board is required to obtain a fairness opinion in order to satisfy its duty of care in approving a merger agreement, since the Van Gorkom opinion, it has become standard practice for the board of directors of a public target corporation to receive an opinion from an investment banking firm or other valuation firm that the consideration being offered in the merger to the target stockholders is fair to such stockholders from a financial point of view.  

Under Section 141(e) of the DGCL, a board is "fully protected” from liability if it relies in good faith on an opinion of an outside valuation firm selected with reasonable care as to matters within the outside firm’s competence, i.e., the fairness of the merger consideration.  However, this reliance must be reasonable and is qualified by the duty of good faith (i.e., boards may not blindly rely on these experts and should be engaged in the review of the fairness presentation and question unreasonable assumptions or "red flags”).  Generally, though, the financial fairness of a proposed transaction is only one of the factors that a board should consider in deciding whether to proceed with the transaction.

The buyer also has an interest in ensuring that the target board follows a proper procedure in approving a merger, since the failure to do so could result in either the merger being enjoined by a court or monetary liability being imposed following a transaction and significant defense costs for which the buyer may ultimately be responsible.  Accordingly, most buyers will insist that the target board receive a fairness opinion and will require a representation to that effect.  They may also request the opportunity to review the opinion to make sure nothing unusual is noted that could put the approval of the transaction at risk or give rise to potential future liability.

As financial advisors utilize different language in their fairness opinions, the actual language of the representation should track the language of the fairness opinion actually received by the target. 

[NTD:  Address likely Buyer request to receive opinion, or even engagement letter, or additional reps re financial advisor’s consent or company’s right to disclose the opinion and analyses.]

3.24.Ti=	Brokers.  

No broker, finder, investment banker or other Person (other than •) is or may be entitled to any brokerage, finder’s or other fee or commission in connection with the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions based upon arrangements or authorizations made by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  

3.25.Ti=	[Full Disclosure.  

3.25.(1).sec=	This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule) does not, and the certificate referred to in Section[•]will not, (i) contain any representation, warranty or information that is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or (ii) omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the representations, warranties and information contained and to be contained herein and therein (in the light of the circumstances under which such representations, warranties and information were or will be made or provided) not false or misleading.]

ARTICLE 4

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to Company, except as set forth or incorporated by reference (a) in the part of the disclosure schedule delivered to Company on the date of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule”) corresponding to the numbered section of this Article IV that includes a particular representation or warranty, or (b) in any other part of the Parent Disclosure Schedule where it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure or the context in which such disclosure is made that such disclosure should qualify a particular representation or warranty, as follows:

COMMENT:

See the introductory Comment to Article III of the Model Tender Offer Agreement for a general overview of the impact of representations in a public company merger agreement with a first step tender offer.

Because the target’s stockholders will only be receiving cash in the tender offer and the merger, and will not be receiving equity of the buyer, the target’s interest in the buyer’s representations will be focused on the buyer’s financial and legal ability to consummate the transaction, and with ensuring their compliance with relevant disclosure obligations and other applicable legal requirements.  Accordingly, the Model Tender Offer Agreement does not include representations regarding the buyer’s SEC reports, financial statements, contracts, undisclosed liabilities or other similar matters.

A general qualification of the representations to the buyer’s SEC reports has not been included in the Model Tender Offer Agreement.  The buyer may argue that it would be unfair for the agreement to be asymmetrical in this regard and propose either that the parallel qualification included for target’s representations be removed (and the buyer may already be arguing for such a change) or that the buyer should also have the benefit of such qualification.  The target may respond that buyer’s representations are relatively limited and focused on matters unrelated to the buyer’s operations, and that there should therefore be no issue with making such representations on an unqualified basis.

As with Comments to Article III of the Model Tender Offer Agreement, Comments in Article IV use the term "representation” by itself to refer to the combined concept of "representations and warranties.”

4.01.Ti=	Organization, Standing and Power.  

4.01.(1).sec=	Parent and Purchaser are corporations or other entities duly incorporated or otherwise formed, validly existing, and in good standing (where such concept is recognized under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or formed) under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation or organization, with all necessary Entity power and authority to conduct their respective businesses as now being conducted and to own, lease or otherwise hold their respective properties and assets.

COMMENT:

This representation mirrors the target’s representation in Section 3.01 of the Model Tender Offer Agreement, with the exception of the representation regarding jurisdictions where the applicable entities are qualified to do business is not included.  Such a representation is not of interest to the target here given its focused interest on Parent’s and Purchaser’s respective abilities to fund and close the Offer and the Merger.

4.01.(2).sec=	Purchaser is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent that was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Contemplated Transactions.  Since the date of its incorporation, Purchaser has not carried on any business or conducted any operations other than the execution of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.

COMMENT:

This representation almost invariably reflects the facts and the buyer usually will raise no objection to its inclusion.  [Both the target and the buyer will desire to maximize the potential for Parent to own greater than 90% of the target’s common stock following the Offer and any exercise of the top-up option so that the second-step merger can be accomplished via short-form merger under Section 253 or Section 267 of the DGCL, and any dilution in the ownership of Purchaser by Parent will make it more difficult to achieve that goal.] [NTD:  ELABORATE ON DILUTION]  

In addition, the target and the buyer will want to avoid any potential claims by shareholders of the surviving corporation regarding the fairness of the merger consideration paid in the second step merger as a result of the surviving corporation’s succession to any assets held by Purchaser, and consequently it would be preferable for both parties that Purchaser have no assets.

4.01.(3).sec=	Parent has delivered to the Company copies of the Organizational Documents of Parent and Purchaser, as currently in effect.  Such Organizational Documents are in full force and effect, and neither Parent nor Purchaser is or has been in violation of any of the provisions thereof.

COMMENT:

Section 4.01 does not provide a corresponding representation to that found in Section 3.01(b) which requires the Company to list all Subsidiaries and make a representation regarding the delivery of the applicable Organizational Documents for each Subsidiary because the target’s shareholders will only be receiving cash in the tender offer and the merger and will not have any continuing interest in the business thereafter.

4.02.Ti=	Authority; No Conflict.  

4.02.(1).sec=	Each of Parent and Purchaser has all necessary Entity power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions.  [The execution and delivery by Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the Contemplated Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Purchaser and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Purchaser are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement and consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.] [NTD:  SEE BELOW]  Parent and Purchaser have each duly executed and delivered this Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Legal Requirement affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and to general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding whether in equity or at law).

COMMENT:

If Purchaser holds less than 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock following the consummation of the Offer (including any subsequent offering period, if applicable) and the exercise of the top-up option, Section 251 of the DGCL will apply, which requires that each of the constituent corporations submit the executed merger agreement to its stockholders for adoption subsequent to execution of the agreement and adoption of a resolution by the corporation’s board of directors approving the agreement and declaring its advisability.  In order for the Model Tender Offer Agreement to be properly authorized and effected by Purchaser under Section 251 of the DGCL, five events must occur in the following order:  

(1)	Purchaser’s board of directors must adopt a resolution approving the agreement and declaring its advisability; 

(2)	officers of Purchaser must execute and acknowledge the agreement; 

(3)	the agreement must be submitted to Purchaser’s stockholders (i.e., Parent) for adoption; 

(4)	the agreement must be certified; and 

(5)	the agreement or the certificate of merger must be filed with the Secretary of State.

If, on the other hand, Purchaser holds 90% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock following the consummation of the Offer (including any subsequent offering period, if applicable) and the exercise of the top-up option, Section 6.04 of the Model Tender Offer Agreement provides that the parties will effect a short-form merger under Section 253 or Section 267 of the DGCL as soon as practicable thereafter, which requires only that the parent entity in such merger (i.e., Purchaser) execute and file a certificate of its ownership and merger with the Secretary of State that sets forth a copy of the resolutions of its board of directors approving the merger and states that the merger has been approved by its shareholders.  Because the target will not be wholly-owned, the resolutions of the board of directors must include the terms and conditions of the Merger.  However, because it will not be known at the time the agreement is signed whether or not Purchaser will hold 90% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock following the consummation of the Offer, and the representation provides that all necessary corporate action has been taken on the part of Parent and Purchaser as of signing, they will in any case need to proceed under items (1)-(4) of the preceding paragraph substantially concurrently with signing.

Purchaser Stockholder Approval.  As a practical matter, no meeting of Purchaser’s stockholders will be held to adopt the Model Tender Offer Agreement.  Instead Parent (as Purchaser’s sole stockholder) will execute a written consent adopting the Model Tender Offer Agreement.  A meeting of stockholders is not required to approve a merger agreement if the agreement is approved by written consent pursuant to Section 228 of the DGCL by a majority of the holders of the stock entitled to vote on the agreement.  If a written consent is used, the secretarial certification should state that stockholder approval was obtained pursuant to written consent and that the notice required by Section 228(c) of the DGCL, if any, has been given.

It is important to remember that the buyer may not approve a merger agreement under Delaware law prior to its execution by all the parties thereto.  Some merger agreements represent that "Parent has approved the Merger Tender Offer Agreement in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Purchaser.”  This formulation should be avoided as such approval cannot legally occur under Delaware law until the agreement has been executed.  [NTD:  Would it be permissible to include the following language:  "By executing and delivering this Agreement, Parent hereby approves…”?]  [NTD:  GIVEN THIS TIMING CONSTRAINT, SHOULD THE LANGUAGE IN THE REP BE REVISED?  DO WE NEED A COVENANT AS TO PARENT’S POST-SIGNING APPROVAL AS STOCKHOLDER OF PURCHASER?]



4.02.(2).sec=	Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions, will, except as have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect: 

(i)	contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation or breach of (A) the provisions of the Organizational Documents of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) any Legal Requirement or any Order to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, assuming that all filings and notifications in accordance with the HSR Act, and the filing of the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL, have been made; or (C) the provisions of any material Contract or any material Governmental Authorization of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; or 

(ii)	result in the creation of any Encumbrance (other than a Permitted Lien) upon or with respect to any of the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

COMMENT:

This representation mirrors the target’s representation in Section 3.02(c) of the Model Tender Offer Agreement.  

The buyer may suggest that because of the target’s limited interests in the buyer’s operations and assets, the scope of the representation should be reduced to not extend to subsidiaries other than Purchaser, to unrelated laws and contracts and/or to liens upon the buyer’s assets.  The target may respond that the representation is limited only to those matters that could have Parent Material Adverse Effect, and therefore that the scope of the representation is limited in a manner consistent with the target’s interests in the transaction.

4.02.(3).sec=	The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser do not, and the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions by Parent and Purchaser will not, require any Consent of, or filing with or notification to, any Person, except:

(i)	for (A) applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and Blue Sky Laws, (B) the pre-merger notification requirements of the HSR Act, (C) filing of a certificate of merger as required by the DGCL and (D) the non-United States competition, antitrust and investment laws set forth in Part 3.2(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and 

(ii)	where failure to obtain such Consents, or to make such filings or notifications, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.03.Ti=	Offer Documents; Information Supplied.  

4.03.(1).sec=	None of the Offer Documents will, at the time such document is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is first published, sent or given to the Company’s stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to information expressly identified by the Company as having been provided for such purpose.  Each of the Offer Documents will, at the time that such document is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is first published, sent or given to the Company’s stockholders, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

4.03.(2).sec=	None of the information supplied by or on behalf of Parent, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion in the [Proxy Statement, Information Statement or the] Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time that such document is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is first published, sent or given to the Company’s stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

COMMENT:

[NTD:  Discuss.  While the target’s filing of the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC is covered by Section 3.04(c), there is asymmetry in terms of the times to which the representation relates and there is no representation from the target covering other documents disseminated by the Company to its shareholders in connection with the transactions or information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Offer Documents.]

4.04.Ti=	Brokers.  

Neither Parent nor Purchaser, nor any of their respective officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finder’s fees in connection with the Transactions except [_________], whose fees and expenses will be paid by Parent in accordance with Parent’s agreement with such firm.

COMMENT:

The target’s interest in obtaining this representation from the buyer is largely to ensure that there is no relationship between its own financial advisors and those employed by buyer, and therefore no conflict of interest.

4.05.Ti=	Absence of Litigation.  

There is no suit, action or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any claim, Subsidiary of Parent that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.  There is no Judgment outstanding against Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or any of their respective assets that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.  Parent has not received any written notification of, and to the knowledge of Parent there is no, investigation by any Governmental Entity involving Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or any of their respective assets that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.06.Ti=	Ownership of Company Common Stock.  

None of Parent, Purchaser or any of their "affiliates” or "associates” is, or at any time during the last three (3) years has been, an "interested stockholder” (as such terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of the Company.  Prior to the date hereof, neither Parent nor Purchaser has taken, or authorized or permitted any Representatives of Parent or Purchaser to take, any action that would reasonably be expected to cause, Parent Purchaser or any of their "affiliates” or "associates” to be deemed an "interested stockholder” (as such term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) or otherwise render Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger.

COMMENT:

This representation confirms that no higher vote of the target’s stockholders will be required under Section 203 of the DGCL as a result of the buyer owning 15% or more of the target’s voting stock without prior board approval and supports a determination that buyer is not an "affiliate” of target within the meaning of the Rule 13E-3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  This representation also confirms that, at the time the target board approves the merger agreement, neither Parent nor Purchaser will be an "interested stockholder” of the target; a prerequisite to the applicability of Section 251(h).

Under Rule 13E-3, if the buyer is affiliated with the target, and the target’s capital stock is being cashed-out in the transaction and will therefore no longer be listed on any securities exchange or registered with the SEC, both the buyer and the target would be required to file and disseminate to the target’s stockholders a Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3 that requires substantially enhanced disclosures regarding the transactions, the background thereof and the interests of the various parties therein.  Schedule TO allows the buyer to combine the Schedule TO and Schedule 13E-3 into one filing.

[NTD:  Discuss how much detail to provide regarding 13E-3 transactions.]

4.07.Ti=	Financing.  

Parent and Purchaser have sufficient funds available to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and, at the expiration of the Offer and the Effective Time, Parent and Purchaser will have available all of the funds necessary for the acquisition of all shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, as the case may be, to pay all fees and expenses in connection therewith, to make payments to holders of Company Options pursuant to Section 2.05 and to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.

4.08.Ti=	Pre-Closing Funding.  

Parent has and will continue to have sufficient working capital to meet its pre-Closing obligations hereunder, including funds to pay any filing fees and the costs of applying for, and obtaining, all approvals from Governmental Bodies.

COMMENT:

Sections 4.07 and 4.08 require the buyer to represent that it will have sufficient cash available to fund each of the payments they will be required to make at each transaction stage, as well as all of their expenses.

Financing.  Should it be contemplated that the buyer will obtain equity and/or debt financing in connection with the transactions, the buyer will not be able to represent that it has such funds available currently, and the target will typically request that the buyer make representations regarding those financing arrangements, regardless of whether the agreement includes any direct financing conditionality or indirect financing conditionality through inclusion of a financing related reverse break-up fee.  The following is an example of a provision that could be proposed by the target:

"Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of:

(i) executed commitment letters (as the same may be amended pursuant to Section ____, the "Debt Financing Commitments”), pursuant to which the lenders parties thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide or cause to be provided the debt amounts set forth therein (the "Debt Financing”), and 

(ii) executed equity commitment letters (the "Equity Financing Commitments”, and together with the Debt Financing Commitments, the "Financing Commitments”), pursuant to which [●] and [●] have committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest the amount set forth therein (the "Equity Financing,” and together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing”).

Each of the Equity Financing Commitments is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and of the other parties thereto.  Except as permitted by Section _____, the Debt Financing Commitments are in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and the other parties thereto.  

None of the Financing Commitments has been or will be amended or modified, and the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been and will not be withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, except as permitted by this Agreement.  No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Purchaser under any Financing Commitment, and neither Parent nor Purchaser has any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing needed to be satisfied by it in any of the Financing Commitments.  There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the Financing Commitments and there are no contractual or other contingencies under any contract, agreement, commitment, side letter or other arrangement relating to the Financing Commitments which permit any lender or investor to reduce the amount of any Financing or, except as provided in the Debt Financing Commitments, that would adversely affect or delay the availability of any Financing.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Financing Commitments, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the net proceeds contemplated from the Financing, together with other financial resources of Parent and Purchaser, including cash on hand, will, in the aggregate, through the expiration of the Offer and at the Acceptance Time, Effective Time and the Closing, provide funds to Parent and Purchaser sufficient for the acquisition of all shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, as the case may be, to pay all fees and expenses in connection therewith, to make payments to holders of Company Options pursuant to Section 2.04 and to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.”

In some cases, including most acquisitions sponsored by private equity funds, the Parent entity proposed by the buyer will itself be a shell company that is formed for purposes of the acquisition having a sole source of funding consisting of an equity commitment from the funded buyer entity, such as the applicable private equity fund.  The target may argue that the funded buyer entity should either directly be party to the agreement as the "Parent” or provide a guaranty of all obligations of the Parent and Purchaser under the agreement.  Alternatively, the target may insist that the target be an express third party beneficiary of the equity commitment letter, and that funding under the equity commitment letter unconditionally cover all potential obligations of Parent and Purchaser under the agreement, and not just payments to stockholders upon consummation of the transactions as will frequently be proposed by buyers.  In either case, the target’s position will be that it should be no worse off in a structure using a parent shell entity backed by a guaranty or equity commitment structure than it would be if the funded buyer entity was a direct party to the agreement.

If the buyer’s equity commitment set forth in the equity commitment letter is for less than the full amount of Parent’s potential obligations under the agreement, as will typically be the case, the amount of such equity commitment will serve as an effective cap on the buyer’s potential liability for breaches of the Model Tender Offer Agreement.  In cases where a limited guaranty is used rather than an equity commitment letter, the buyer will typically include a cap on its liability thereunder, which will be subject to negotiation between the buyer and the target.  If a reverse break-up fee structure is included in the agreement, the equity commitment letter and/or guaranty will include limitations on liability that are consistent therewith.

As noted [cross-reference to discussion of dual-track structure], Regulation U and Regulation X will place limits on the buyer’s ability to use Company Common Stock acquired in the Offer as collateral to obtain financing to make such purchases, and may drive the buyer and the target towards a dual-track tender offer/traditional stockholders meeting structure similar to that utilized in the Burger King and Gymboree transactions.

COMMENT



A non-solicitation or "no-shop” provision is one of the deal protection provisions utilized to deter third parties from making a bid for the target between the date of the tender offer agreement and the closing of the tender offer/merger transaction and are included in some form in almost every public tender/merger agreement.  While in theory a target company may resist the inclusion of a no-shop provision and request that the purchaser instead rely on general remedies for breach of contract, it would be unusual for a purchaser to agree to do so, especially in light of the significant money, resources, opportunity cost and time that are required in order to pursue and complete any transaction. It is more likely that the no-shop is drafted to include various exceptions (as discussed below). In cases where the target company has significant bargaining power, it may be able to negotiate other favorable deal terms in exchange for its agreement to the terms and scope of the no-shop restrictions. 



Negotiating the No-Shop.  The no-shop provision must be evaluated in the context of the facts and circumstances of the particular transaction.  In that regard, there are many factors that should be considered by the target when evaluating and negotiating a no-shop, such as (i) whether the target board’s approval of the transaction and related deal protections will be reviewed under the business judgment rule or some form of enhanced scrutiny, (ii) whether and to what extent the target has previously been shopped, (iii) whether and to what extent voting agreements have been obtained from target stockholders, (iv) whether other deal protections are available and, if so, the relative strength of such deal protections, (v) whether the target board believes that the buyer’s offer is preemptive or otherwise at the high end of a range of fair values, (vi) whether and to what extent the target is able to obtain concessions from the buyer in exchange for the deal no-shop, and (vii) whether the target is in a precarious financial condition or is otherwise under strong pressure to be acquired.

There is an obvious tension between the interests of the purchaser and the interests of the target in negotiating the no-shop provision.  The purchaser’s primary interest is in deterring third parties from making a competing bid for the target, whereas the target’s primary interest is in having flexibility to entertain competing bids that might be more favorable to the target’s stockholders than the purchaser’s transaction.  As a result, the no-shop provision is typically one of the most heavily negotiated provisions in a merger agreement.  

No-Shop Restrictions. The no shop provision contained in Section 5.02(a) of the Model Agreement generally restricts the target company from (or directing its representatives in) soliciting, providing information to, or engaging in discussions or negotiations of an acquisition proposal by or with a third party.  Section 5.02(a) also includes a requirement that the target company cease any existing discussions with other parties concerning an acquisition transaction. 



Possible Changes to the No Shop that Might Be Proposed By Purchaser.  Given the importance and significance of the no-shop provision, it is likely that the purchaser will propose changes to a number of the terms of the no-shop. 



First, the purchaser may propose making the target strictly liable for any noncompliance of the no-shop by any of target’s representatives whether directed or not.  The target might argue that the target ultimately has no control over the actions of its representatives and can only "direct” its representatives to comply and not "authorize” any non-compliance.



Second, the purchaser may propose expanding the restrictions so as to forbidding the target or its representatives from "encouraging,” facilitating” or "taking any action” that could lead to an acquisition proposal.  The target might argue that these additional restrictions are too broad and excessively vague and ripe for the target to inadvertently or unknowingly breach the covenant.  The target could perhaps get comfortable with expanding the restrictions to cover actions that were "knowingly” or "actively” taken by the target. 



The purchaser may also propose expanding the definition of "Acquisition Proposal” to include "inquiries” or "indications of interests” relating to an Acquisition Transaction and to include in the definition of Acquisition Transactions proposed transactions (1) where the target is a buyer, (2) involving subsidiaries of the target, or (3) involving licenses of a portion of the target’s intellectual property.  The target will likely counter that the terms "inquiries” and "indications of interest” are vague and unlikely to cover anything that would likely interfere with the proposed transaction with the purchaser.  The target will also argue that Acquisition Transactions should not include subsidiaries (unless the target is merely a holding company for one or more operating subsidiaries) and certainly should not include minor subsidiaries.  



Window Shop.  A window shop provision, such as the one contained in the proviso to Section 5.02(a) of the Model Agreement, is an exception to the no-shop and generally permit the target board to furnish information to or enter into discussions with a third party who has made an acquisition proposal if the acquisition proposal is or likely to be a "superior proposal”.  It is important to recognize that the typical window shop exception to a no-shop provision merely permits a target to provide information to and to talk to a third party that has submitted a potential competing bid.  It does not permit a target to solicit or initiate the making or submission of a competing bid or to sign an acquisition agreement with respect to a competing bid.



The term "Acquisition Proposal”, and the associated term "Acquisition Transaction,” are defined in the Model Agreement in a seller-favorable way in that it only includes (i) a possible acquisition transaction involving the target, and not any subsidiary of the target, (ii) a possible transaction in which the third party acquires more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the target, and (iii) asset sales and technology licenses constituting 25% or more of the target’s consolidated net revenues, net income, or assets. 



Possible Changes to the Window Shop that Might Be Proposed By Purchaser. The purchaser may propose limiting the window shop in a number of ways.  

First, the purchaser may argue that the target’s ability to furnish nonpublic information or enter into discussions with a third party in response to an Acquisition Proposal only apply if the Acquisition Proposal "is a Superior Proposal.”  However, the target may counter this argument by asserting that imposing a requirement that the Acquisition Proposal must constitute a Superior Proposal prior to discussions or the furnishing of information is too high a standard and that the third party will likely need access to confidential information and to have discussions with the target prior to making a definitive competing proposal.  The purchaser may also propose lowering the applicable percentages used in the definition of Acquisition Transaction (e.g., to 15%).

The purchaser may also propose providing that neither the target nor any of its representatives have violated any of the restrictions in Section 5.02 The target should limit this by proposing that the proposal did not directly result from a material breach of the restrictions of Section 5.02(a) as minor and unrelated breaches of the no-shop should not bar the target board from considering and negotiating a legitimate competing proposal. 

Third, the purchaser will likely propose that the target board have concluded in good faith, after having taken into account the advice or opinion of its outside legal counsel, that taking such action is required in order for the target board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the target’s stockholders under applicable law.

Fourth, the purchaser may propose requiring that the confidentiality agreement to be entered into by the Person making the Acquisition Proposal be on terms (including a "standstill” undertaking) no less favorable than the terms contained in the confidentiality agreement between the purchaser and the target.

Fiduciary Out.  The no-shop provision in this Model Agreement includes a typical fiduciary out exception permitting the target to negotiate and complete a transaction with a third party and for the target board to change the its recommendation in favor of the transaction with the purchaser if the target board determines in good faith that failing to do so is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the target’s stockholders. In many cases the fiduciary out requires that the target board make a determination that the alternative acquisition proposal is a "superior proposal” before it can act without the no-shop restriction or terminate the tender agreement. 

If the purchaser has considerable leverage in the transaction and wants to take an aggressive "take it or leave it" position by offering a pure no-shop clause without exception, purchaser's counsel should consider the possibility that a court could invalidate, if challenged, the entire covenant (include cite). A no-shop that is too restrictive is generally not enforceable, except in very limited circumstances, because it prevents the target board from satisfying its fiduciary duties to the target stockholders.  As a result, the inclusion of a fiduciary out to a no-shop provision is market practice in public M&A transactions.



Matching rights are customarily included in tender and merger agreements, but the terms vary depending on the parties, their respective bargaining power and the transaction. Although it would be unusual for there to be no matching right, the target company should consider restricting the nature and terms of the purchaser’s right to have a "last look", and limit that right to only a one-time match. Limiting the match in this manner will increase the likelihood that the purchaser, given that it has only one opportunity to top the competing bid, is more likely to put forth its best counteroffer without having to go through several rounds of a protracted negotiation with each of the two competing bidders.



Section 5.02(b) of the Model Agreement provides that the target board may change its recommendation or enter into an agreement relating to an acquisition proposal from a third party if:



•	after having received an Acquisition Proposal, the target board has determined that the such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal; 

•	the target board has determined that the failure to effect the change in recommendation is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law;

•	the target has notified the purchaser of its intention to make the change in recommendation;

•	the target makes its representatives available during the three calendar days following delivery of such notice to discuss modifications to the terms of the tender offer agreement;

•	if purchaser delivers a binding offer to amend the terms of the tender offer agreement during the three calendar day period, the target board has again determined that the failure to effect the change in recommendation to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

The Model Agreement also includes that ability of the target company to change its recommendation upon becoming aware of an intervening event or circumstance that the target board was unaware of at the signing of the agreement that makes it not advisable to complete the transaction. The purchaser may argue against the inclusion of this exception to the no-shop provision because it is overly broad and perhaps not necessary under applicable legal requirements. The purchaser could also argue that if there is an intervening event and the proposed transaction is no longer favorable, then the target stockholders would simply not tender their shares and the minimum condition would not be satisfied. 



Possible Changes to the Fiduciary Exception that Might Be Proposed By Purchaser.  Depending on the circumstances, the purchaser might propose a number of changes to the fiduciary exception contained in Section 5.02(a).

First, the purchaser might have a number of comments with respect to the definition of "Superior Proposal” contained in Section 9.6.  The purchaser may suggest that only proposals for all of the outstanding shares of common stock, or all or substantially all of the assets, of the target should qualify as a "Superior Proposal” if the other requirements contained in the definition are also satisfied.  The purchaser might also argue that the target board’s determination as to whether a proposal constitutes a "Superior Proposal” should be based on a higher standard, such as the target board’s reasonable judgment, rather than the target board’s good faith. 

A second objection that the purchaser may raise in relation to the definition of "Superior Proposal” might be that the target board’s determination be based on a written opinion of a financial advisor.  However, the target could argue that because of the inherent uncertainties in rendering such an opinion, it might be difficult and costly to obtain such an opinion.  Furthermore, there is Delaware case law indicating that a board is not obligated to heed the counsel or advice of any of its advisors and must make its own determination. 

A final issue with the term "Superior Proposal” is what conditions beyond financial superiority must be satisfied for a competing proposal to be deemed a Superior Proposal.  The purchaser may propose that the definition of Superior Proposal include a condition that any financing required to consummate the competing proposal must be committed and be reasonably capable of being obtained.  A target might object to this additional requirement as to the financing on the ground that so long as the target board believes that the transaction is reasonably capable of being consummated, the specifics with regard to the financing should only go to the target board’s determination of the financial superiority of the proposal.  The purchaser might also require that the target board take into account the identity of the person making the proposal.  

The purchaser may try to increase the time period required for the purchaser company to give notice of its intent to exercise its matching right. The purchaser will likely argue that it needs more time in order for its board to consider and formulate a response to the competing bid, and to negotiate any necessary changes to its financing arrangements.  



Further, the purchaser target might seek to limit the fiduciary exception y providing that the target company cannot use the fiduciary exception if there has been a breach of the no-shop undertaking.  The target company will likely counter this argument by arguing that while a violation by the target company or its representatives of the no-shop might give rise to a failure of a condition or breach of contract claim or a termination right, the ability of the target company to provide information or enter into discussions with a third party should not depend on whether the target company violated any of the no-shop restrictions.  By way of example, the target company might argue that even if it violated the no-shop by not providing the buyer with the required notice of an acquisition proposal that it received from a third party, it should not be prohibited from providing information to a different third party in response to its acquisition proposal.  The target might also argue that any breach must be material, intentional, or both.  

Prohibition on Release of Standstill.  The purchaser may propose that the target company be prohibited from releasing any person from any confidentiality or "standstill” agreement entered into by the target company in connection with a possible merger or acquisition transaction and requires the target to enforce such confidentiality and standstill provisions at the request of the buyer.  If so, the target might object to this requirement and argue that the target board should have the right to make such a waiver if it determines, after consultation with its legal counsel, that it is necessary to release a third party from a standstill agreement in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the target stockholders.  The purchaser may also require that the target be required to request from every party that signed such a confidentiality or standstill agreement in connection with a possible merger or acquisition transaction prior to the signing of the tender agreement return all confidential information provided by the target to the third party because it does not want any potential bidder to remain in possession of confidential information.  The target might argue that the requirement is too onerous or unnecessary given that the third party continues to be bound by the confidentiality undertaking.  

Compliance with Rules 14d-9, 14e-2(a) and Item 1012(a).  Section 5.02(e) of the Model Agreement permits the target board to comply with Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) under the Exchange Act, provided that the board cannot take any action which would constitute a Change in Recommendation without complying with the additional requirements of Section 5.02.  Rule 14e-2(a) of the Exchange Act requires the target to publish, within 10 business days following the commencement of a tender offer with respect to it, a statement disclosing whether the target (i) recommends acceptance or rejection of the tender offer, (ii) expresses no opinion and is remaining neutral toward the tender offer, or (iii) is unable to take a position with respect to the tender offer.  Rule 14e-2(a) further requires the target to include the reasons for the position disclosed pursuant to the foregoing.  Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act governs communications by the target with respect to the tender offer to which it is subject.  Specifically, Rule 14d-9(b) prohibits the target board from soliciting or making a recommendation to its security holders until a Schedule 14D-9 is filed with the SEC containing the target board’s recommendation as required under Rule 14e-2(a).  In addition, Rule 14d-9(f) permits the target board to issue a "stop, look and listen” release, stating that, among other things, the tender offer is under consideration by the target board and that the Company’s stockholders are requested to defer making a determination whether to accept or reject the tender offer until it has been advised of the target board’s position.  Item 1012(a) permits more disclosure than expressly permitted under Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2, including describing actions recommended by the target board beyond the statement of the target board’s position.  

Other Possible Exceptions to the No Shop

Go Shop.  

A go-shop is another exception to the no-shop restrictions that specifically allows the target company to seek out other potential bidders for a specified period of time, usually between 30 to 60 days after the date of signing of the tender agreement. Go-shop provisions are sometimes considered in connection with transactions in which the target company has not conducted an auction or done a pre signing market check and the target board has potential concerns about satisfying its Revlon duties, such as a management buyout, or single bidder situations.  Go-shops are primarily found in private equity transactions because private equity buyers tend to prefer avoiding a full auction process, especially the potential of competing against strategic companies.  



Go shops typically include the right to match a superior proposal received during the go-shop period (in a manner similar to the fiduciary out discussed above), (ii) usually have a lower break-up fee payable by the target company if it terminates the tender agreement due to a superior proposal received during the go-shop period, and (ii) frequently, the right to continue to discussions or negotiations with any competing bidders that arise during the go-shop period.

[provided, that no access or information pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made or deemed made by the Company herein].  [NTD:  Delete for seller-friendly first draft?]  The information obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.01(a) shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

COMMENT:

During the pre-closing period, Parent will seek to be informed about developments that may have a material impact on the Company.  Parent in particular needs access to appropriate information so that it is in as good a position as possible to evaluate the accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties and to determine whether it desires, and is obligated, to continue with or consummate the Offer.  This is important both at the closing and prior to the closing, since Parent has the right to terminate the Model Agreement if there has been a breach of a representation or warranty of the Company that is not cured within a specified period (see Section 8.01(g) of the Model Agreement).  Parent needs these rights both prior to the Acceptance Time and during the period in between the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time, which could be an extended period of time if Parent does not obtain a sufficient number of the shares of Company Common Stock to complete a short-form second step merger pursuant to DGCL Section 253 or Section 267. 

Even if the information does not relate directly to Parent’s specific rights under the Agreement, if Parent has timely knowledge of events it will have more of an opportunity to consult with the Company and can better plan for contingencies.  

This covenant also supports Parent’s preparations for integrating the two organizations after the closing.  As one example, information about the Company must be included in Parent’s SEC filings covering any post-closing period.  Given the certifications that Parent’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer must file with the SEC pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Parent will seek to use the pre-closing period to evaluate in more detail the adequacy of the Company’s internal financial controls and disclosure controls and procedures. 

Limits on Access.  Section 6.01(b) addresses the Company’s interest in preventing regulatory and other legal problems, such as antitrust gun-jumping (discussed in further detail below), associated with providing access to Parent.  The Company has an interest in preventing these problems whether a deal closes or not.  Parent also has an interest in preventing these problems, as Parent will suffer from the adverse consequences if it completes the acquisition and acquires the Company; however, Parent does not want to allow these concerns to act as an undue barrier to receiving information.  With respect to obligations of confidentiality, the Company has provided that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consent of third parties.  The parties may be able to take steps to address concerns relating to attorney client privilege by entering into a joint defense agreement.  

The Company generally will want to make clear that it is not required to share information with respect to the deliberations of the Company Board in connection with the execution of the Model Agreement, such as board minutes and presentations.  Similarly, the Company will also want to ensure that any obligations it has to provide information with respect to Acquisition Proposals be governed by the non-solicitation covenant in Section 5.02. 

Antitrust Gun-Jumping.  Although the parties have agreed to merge, the antitrust laws will continue to regulate competitive activities until the merger is consummated.  Accordingly, appropriate care must be taken in the parties’ exchange of competitively sensitive information.  Drawing the line in this area is not always easy, but great caution should be exercised with respect to any exchange of information regarding open contract bids, bidding or pricing practices, pricing or specific marketing plans and other comparable information.  Exchanges of information among competitors can give rise to serious concern that those agreements evidence an agreement in restraint of trade.  The parties likely will have faced similar issues when conducting due diligence prior to execution of the Model Agreement.

The risk of violating antitrust laws may be mitigated by taking steps to control the dissemination and use of the information within Parent, such as by:

•	Limiting the information exchanged to that truly needed for due diligence or integration planning.

•	Timing the information exchange so that it occurs only when the need for the information is clear.

•	Restricting the recipients of the information to those within Parent with a clear need to know and avoiding the provision of the information to employees charged with responsibility for competitive decision-making.  To provide a clear record of such safeguards, a written undertaking by Parent to restrict the dissemination of sensitive information may be advisable.

•	Conducting due diligence in more competitively sensitive areas through third party intermediaries who are put under confidentiality agreements.  These third-party intermediaries can then assess the competitively sensitive information, and advise the party they represent of the implications of the information reviewed, without revealing the specific details of the sensitive information in a manner raising antitrust concern.  This will allow confirmatory due diligence to proceed while shielding the two competitors from access to information presenting the most antitrust risk.

These steps also can help reduce the business risk inherent in exchanging information with a buyer who is or may be a competitor to the Company.

Impact on Representations and Warranties.  The parties will carefully negotiate a set of representations and warranties that will be made by the Company as part of the Agreement.  The representations and warranties serve a number of purposes, including the allocation of risk between the Company and Parent.  It is important for both parties that that information the Company provides to Parent pursuant to Section 6.01 not modify these representations and warranties.  For example, the Company generally wants to avoid any implication that it is representing and warranting to the accuracy of any reports or documents given to Parent in response to an information request.  Similarly, Parent generally will want to avoid a scenario where the Company may update its representations and warranties and potentially cure breaches by providing information pursuant to this covenant.  [The proviso at the end of the first sentence of Section 6.01(a) addresses this concern by stating that no access or information provided pursuant to Section 6.01 shall modify any of the Company’s representations and warranties.] [NTD:  Conform to placement in text as initial text or Purchaser comment.]

Possible Changes To The Access Covenant That Might Be Suggested by Parent.  Parent may have a number of comments to this provision, such as the following:  

First, Parent will generally try to expand the scope of materials covered by the covenant.  In addition to the items already covered, Parent may want the Company to provide it with access to work papers and other documents, and additional financial, operating and other data and information regarding the Company.  The Company may resist granting Parent access to auditor work papers, as it will not be able to force its auditors to deliver those work papers to Parent.  At a minimum, the Company would likely insist that access to work papers be conditioned on Parent entering into a customary confidentiality agreement that is acceptable to the Company’s auditors.  [Relatedly, while this is arguable already covered, Parent may want to explicitly require that its access to any virtual data rooms or other diligence materials continue uninterrupted.]  [NTD:  Please elaborate.]

Second, Parent may remove some of the express limits in Section 6.01(b) and argue that the agreement should leave those issues for Parent to consider in making its requests for information.  If the transaction closes, the adverse consequences created by the disclosures will be Parent’s problems going forward.  In the alternative, Parent may seek to impose an obligation on the Company to find alternative means to provide information to avoid the consequences set forth in Section 6.01(b), as the provision does with respect to information subject to a confidentiality undertaking. 

Third, Parent may insert affirmative obligations to provide information, such as requiring the Company to provide Parent with all material operating and financial reports prepared for the Company’s management, including copies of any unaudited monthly consolidated financial statements.  Similarly, Parent may also want an affirmative right to meet and interview employees of the Company, especially in situations where Parent has not had the ability to conduct the requisite amount of diligence prior to execution of the Model Agreement.  The Company, if it is to accept such an obligation, may seek to qualify this right with a reasonableness standard.

Fourth, Parent may want to require the Company to consult with outside counsel in connection with its determination that applicable law or a confidentiality restriction prohibits the sharing of information with Parent.  This requirement may give Parent comfort that the Company will at the very least need to consult with a qualified third party prior to making the determination that there is a legal prohibition with sharing the information.  If Parent wanted to be aggressive, it could require that the Company not only consult with outside counsel but that is also receive the advice of outside counsel that such a legal prohibition exists.  The Company may resist such a requirement as it could impose a level of formality and costs associated with retaining counsel that is overly burdensome.

6.02.Ti=	Notification.  

During the Pre-Closing Period, each Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any Party to effect any of the Contemplated Transactions not to be satisfied.  No notification pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall limit or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of the Parties contained in this Agreement.

COMMENT:

This covenant requires each of the parties to notify the others upon the occurrence of any event, including a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant, that would cause a closing condition to not be satisfied.  As a practical matter, this covenant will be of more concern to the Company than Parent given the number of representations and warranties made by the Company in the merger agreement and the fact that most of the covenants apply to actions it is required to take or prohibited from taking prior to closing. 

Possible Changes To The Notification Covenant That Might Be Suggested by Parent.  Parent may seek to increase the scope of the obligation of the Company to provide notice beyond those events that would cause closing conditions to be satisfied.  Generally, the bring down of the representations and warranties of the Company is subject to a material adverse effect standard, and Parent may want the Company to notify it of breaches that are material but which do not satisfy that high standard in order to make plans for the Company following the closing and to get an accurate picture of the Company.  The Company may resist this expansion on the basis that Parent should only be entitled to notices of breaches that would give it the right to not close and to terminate the merger agreement.  

6.03.Ti=	[Proxy Statement [or Information Statement].]  

6.03.(1).sec=	If after the Acceptance Time and, to the extent applicable, any Subsequent Offering Period, the adoption of this Agreement by the Company’s stockholders is required by applicable Legal Requirements to consummate the Merger, the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement and cause it to be filed with the SEC [or, if Parent specifies that adoption of this Agreement be effected by the written consent of the stockholders of the Company without a meeting (the "Stockholder Consent”), the Company shall prepare an information statement with respect to the Stockholder Consent (the "Information Statement”)].  Parent shall furnish to the Company all information concerning it and Purchaser and their respective officers, directors, Affiliates and agents as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement [or Information Statement, as applicable,] and any amendment thereto and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement [or Information Statement, as applicable,] and the resolution of comments (if any) to the Proxy Statement [or Information Statement, as applicable,] referred to below.  Parent and the Company shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement [or Information Statement, as applicable,] to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.

6.03.(2).sec=	The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement [or Information Statement, as applicable,] if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements.

6.03.(3).sec=	The Company will advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the staff of the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement [or Information Statement, as applicable,] or comments thereon or responses thereto.

COMMENT:

In Article II of the Agreement, Purchaser has agreed to consummate a second-step merger following the completion of the tender offer.  Because this Agreement is governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL, no vote is required to adopt the second-step merger, and this Section may be omitted.  Nonetheless, this Section is included in this Model Agreement to provide example and discussion in the event an agreement is not governed by DGCL Section 251(h).  See generally Comment to Recitals.

If DGCL Section 251(h) is inapplicable and Purchaser owns 90% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, after completing any subsequent offering period and exercising the top-up option, Purchaser can complete a short form merger.  If Purchaser does not acquire 90% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, completion of the second step merger will require the Company to convene a meeting of its stockholders or, if permitted by the Company’s organizational documents, for the Company’s stockholders to act by written consent, in each case, to adopt the merger agreement.  

Pursuant to DGCL Section 251, a merger not governed by DGCL Section 251(h) must be submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders at an annual or special meeting called for that purpose.  Under the DGCL, stockholders must be given at least 20 days prior notice of the meeting.  The solicitation by the Company of its stockholders for votes in favor of the merger will be subject to the federal proxy rules, which require that Company to prepare proxy solicitation materials and obtain clearance of the materials from the SEC prior to delivering such materials to its stockholders.  The instructions to Schedule 14A require that the proxy solicitation materials be mailed to stockholders of the Company no later than 20 business days prior to the date of the meeting if the Company incorporates by reference any document or portion or a document other than its annual report into the proxy statement.  As it is routine practice to incorporate documents by reference into a proxy statement, the practical effect of this instruction is to require the Company stockholder meeting to take place at least 20 business days following the mailing of the proxy statement.  

If permitted by the Company’s articles of incorporation and applicable state law, the second-step merger may also be approved by written consent in lieu of a meeting of stockholders.  For Delaware corporations, DGCL Section 228 provides that stockholders may take action by written consent unless otherwise provided in the Company’s certificate of incorporation.  DGCL Section 228 permits corporate action without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing is executed by the holders of stock having sufficient votes to authorize such action at a meeting.  Following consummation of the Offer, Purchaser would have sufficient shares to approve the second-step Merger by written consent without the action of any other stockholder.  

The taking of action by written consent to approve a second-step merger is subject to Rule 14C under the Securities Exchange Act.  Rule 14C-2 requires an information statement to be sent to the Company’s stockholders at least 20 days prior to the effectiveness of the action by written consent, even if the Company does not solicit the consent of its stockholders.  A preliminary copy of the information statement must be filed with the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date definitive copies are sent to the Company’s stockholders.

For a discussion of the use of either a proxy statement or information statement as a notice of appraisal rights, see Comment to Section 1.02.

Section 6.03, in combination with Section 6.04, sets forth the parties’ contractual commitments to take the steps required to complete the second-step Merger.  Section 6.03 obligates the Company to prepare and file a proxy statement or information statement if approval of the Company’s stockholders is required to complete the Merger.  The parties preferred outcome is that Purchaser acquires a sufficient number of the Company’s shares through the Offer and top-up option to complete a short-form second step Merger, in which case no proxy or information statement will be required.  

"Dual Track” Tender Offer and Merger Filings.  From a timing perspective, the Company is typically only obligated to prepare and file a proxy or information statement after the Acceptance Time and any Subsequent Offering Period, so that the substantial effort required to complete the proxy statement or information statement is only undertaken if necessary.  However, in a number of recent transactions the parties have agreed to prepare and file a proxy statement or information statement prior to completion of the Offer.  In those cases, the parties use a "dual track” structure whereby completion of the transaction through a tender offer followed by a merger advances alongside efforts to complete the transaction through a traditional one-step merger.  If Parent does not obtain a sufficient number of the Company’s shares through the tender offer to complete a short-form second step merger, the "dual track” structure minimizes the delay associated with preparing the proxy statement and convening a stockholder meeting in order to obtain stockholder approval for the merger. 

The dual track structure has become increasingly used in front end tender offer transactions where the minimum condition is set far in excess of a majority of outstanding shares.  This is the case where the acquiror is a private equity firm and due to its financing requirements, it needs to acquire sufficient shares (when combined with the top-up option) to consummate the short form merger concurrently with or very shortly after the closing of the tender offer.  As a result of these constraints, the minimum condition will be set at that percentage of shares which will only require the acquiror to consummate the tender offer at a level which ensures that it will also be able to consummate a short form merger.  If this minimum condition percentage is sufficiently high, the parties may wish to have the more traditional single step merger process started as a back-up plan in the event that the high number of shares to satisfy the condition is not met.  In the event the dual track structure is used, the closing conditions will need to be modified to include more traditional single-step merger closing conditions, such as accuracy of representations and warranties and compliance with covenants.  [NTD:  Add reference to SEC 14e-5 position.]

Parent Review.  The obligation to prepare and file the proxy or information statement falls upon the Company.  Parent has a significant interest in ensuring that the Company files the proxy or information statement as promptly as practicable and in compliance with all applicable SEC requirements.  In its comments on this covenant, Parent can add language to 6.03(a) to specify that the Company will prepare and file the proxy statement or information statement as promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time and any Subsequent Offering Period.  Parent can also ask for the right to review and comment on the proxy statement or information statement before it is filed with the SEC.  Similarly, while Section 6.03(c) provides that the Company will advise Parent of the receipt of any SEC comments, Parent may prefer to receive copies of any such comments, to the extent they are in writing, and to be informed of the substance of all such comments, to the extent that they are not in writing.  Parent also may want to review and comment on any responses to be submitted in response to such comments.  

6.04.Ti=	[[Written Consent of Stockholders; ]Company Stockholders’ Meeting.]  

6.04.(1).sec=	Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by Section 6.04(b), promptly following the Acceptance Time and, to the extent applicable, any Subsequent Offering Period, Parent shall promptly notify the Company whether Parent and/or its Affiliates elect to adopt this Agreement by executing and delivering the Stockholder Consent as the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, in which case, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with and subject to the requirements of applicable Legal Requirements: 

6.04.(1).(1).sec=	 as promptly as practicable after the Acceptance Time, set a record date for the Stockholder Consent for the purpose of adopting this Agreement; 

6.04.(1).(2).sec=	as promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of the Stockholder Consent, file the Information Statement with the SEC and cause the Information Statement to be printed and mailed to the stockholders of the Company; and 

6.04.(1).(3).sec=	as promptly as practicable after the Company is legally permitted to do so under applicable Legal Requirements, consummate the actions approved in the Stockholder Consent.  

If Parent elects to adopt this Agreement by executing an action by written consent, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly execute, or cause to be executed, the Stockholder Consent with respect to all of the shares of Company Common Stock then owed of record by Parent and its Affiliates or with respect to which Parent or any of its Affiliates otherwise has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power.]

6.04.(2).sec=	If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company’s stockholders is required by applicable Legal Requirements to consummate the Merger, then[, if Parent does not specify that adoption of this Agreement be effected by Stockholder Consent,] the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt of SEC clearance of the Proxy Statement, establish a record date for, call, give notice of (and cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders), and hold a meeting of its stockholders to vote on a proposal to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger (the "Company Stockholders’ Meeting”).  The Company Stockholders’ Meeting shall be held as promptly as practicable after the Acceptance Time (or, as applicable, after the consummation of any Subsequent Offering Period).  Subject to Section 5.02(b), the Proxy Statement shall include the Board Recommendation. At the Company Stockholders’ Meeting, Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by it, Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their other Affiliates in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.   

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the Acceptance Time (or, as applicable, after the consummation of any Subsequent Offering Period) and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent and its Affiliates shall own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock, the Parties shall take all necessary and appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to Purchaser of any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or its Affiliates, to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable thereafter without the Company Stockholders’ Meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

COMMENT:

The covenants in Section 6.04 complement the covenants in Section 6.03, which together require the parties to take the steps necessary to complete the second-step Merger.  Because this Agreement is governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL, no vote is required to adopt the second-step merger, and this Section may be omitted.  Nonetheless, this Section is included in this Model Agreement to provide example and discussion in the event an agreement is not governed by Section 251(h).  See generally Comment to Recitals.

Section 6.03 addresses the preparation and filing with the SEC of a proxy statement or information statement.  Section 6.04 addresses the other actions required to approve the second-step Merger.  Pursuant to Section 6.04, if Parent and its Affiliates obtain a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to consummate a short-form second-step Merger pursuant to DGCL Section 253 or Section 267, they are required to do so as soon as practicable.  

If Parent does not obtain a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to consummate a short-form second-step Merger, Parent is given the right to elect whether to act by written consent or to have the Company call a meeting of its stockholders.  Parent must promptly notify the Company whether it chooses to exercise its election to act by written consent so that the Company can proceed according to the appropriate course of action.  If Parent elects to act by written consent, it must promptly deliver an executed consent to the Company.  If a meeting of the Company’s stockholders is convened, Parent is required to vote in favor of adoption of the Agreement. 

Section 6.04(b) requires that the Proxy Statement include the recommendation of the Company Board that the Company’s stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.  This requirement is subject to Section 5.02(b), which sets forth the standard for the Company Board to effect a Change in Recommendation.  

6.05.Ti=	Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Approvals.  

6.05.(1).sec=	Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.05, Parent and Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Offer Conditions to be satisfied on a timely basis (to the extent the satisfaction of such Offer Conditions is within Parent’s or Purchaser’s direct or indirect control) and to cause Purchaser to purchase shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer on the earliest possible date.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and Purchaser, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable, to: (i) promptly after the date of this Agreement prepare and, in no event later than five business days after the date of this Agreement, file any and all notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by such party under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Antitrust Laws with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions; (ii) use reasonable best efforts promptly to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign Antitrust Laws; (iii) promptly respond to all inquiries or requests from any Governmental Body in connection with the Contemplated Transactions; and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, on a timely basis, all other actions necessary or appropriate for the purpose of consummating and effectuating the Contemplated Transactions.

6.05.(2).sec=	Each Party shall, subject to applicable Legal Requirements and except as prohibited by any applicable representative of any applicable Governmental Body:

6.05.(2).(1).sec=	give the other Parties prompt notice of the commencement or threat of commencement of any Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions,

6.05.(2).(2).sec=	keep the other Party informed as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding or threat,

6.05.(2).(3).sec=	promptly inform the other party of any material communication concerning Antitrust Laws to or from any Governmental Body regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the Contemplated Transactions,

6.05.(2).(4).sec=	consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any Legal Proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, and permit the other party to review any such proposal or submission in advance,

6.05.(2).(5).sec=	not participate in or agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Body in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other Contemplated Transactions unless it consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and

6.05.(2).(6).sec=	promptly take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all actions and steps requested or required by any Governmental Body as a condition to granting any consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods with respect to the Contemplated Transactions or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any Legal Proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing, materially delaying the Acceptance Time or the Closing or delaying the Acceptance Time beyond the Expiration Date, including 

(x)	negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, lease, license, divestiture or disposition of any assets, rights, product lines, or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or the Company or its Subsidiaries and 

(y)	otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that after the Closing Date limits the freedom of Parent or its Subsidiaries’ (including the Surviving Corporation’s) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries’ (including the Surviving Corporation’s) businesses, product lines or assets, 

provided, that the Company and its Subsidiaries will only be required to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, if such action, commitment, agreement, condition or restriction is binding on the Company and its Subsidiaries only following the Acceptance Time.  

The entry by any Governmental Body in any Legal Proceeding of an Order requiring any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to be divested, held separate, or otherwise be legally or commercially limited thereafter (including the businesses, product lines and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Acceptance Time) shall not be deemed to constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement or a failure of any closing condition to be satisfied.

6.05.(3).sec=	Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior to the Acceptance Time.  Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision over its business operations.

6.06.Ti=	Disclosure.  

The Parties shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement or disclosure with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions without the prior approval of the other Parties (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).  Notwithstanding the foregoing:

6.06.(1).sec=	each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in Company SEC Reports, so long as such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually, if approved by the other Parties),

6.06.(2).sec=	a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Parties, issue any such press release or make any such public announcement or statement as may be required by any applicable Legal Requirement or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange; provided, that the Party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement or statement shall first, to the extent practicable, consult with the other Parties about, and allow the other Parties reasonable time to comment in advance on, such press release, public announcement or statement; and

6.06.(3).sec=	the Company need not consult with Parent in connection with any press release, public statement or filing to be issued or made with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (including any "stop, look and listen” release), Superior Proposal or Change in Recommendation.

COMMENT:

This covenant requires prior consultation and approval between the parties before either can make press releases or other public statements regarding the Offer and the Merger.  This covenant is designed to assure that consistent information is given by the parties to the public markets regarding the terms of the transaction and that such communications are consistent with the disclosures made in the tender offer documents filed with the SEC.  

Note that this requirement would apply to all public disclosures about the transaction, including the press release announcing the transaction, and all subsequent public disclosures, including information that has already been disclosed and which is republished or otherwise made available again.  As both parties are public companies, situations may arise where one party may be required under federal securities laws to make a public disclosure before it can obtain the consent of the other party.  Section 6.06 addresses this issue by permitting the party to make disclosures that are legally required or required by any listing rules to which it is subject and imposing only the requirement that it consult to the extent practicable, with the non-disclosing party in advance.  Additionally, in order to minimize the number of times the Parties need to consult with each other regarding the disclosure of the same information but in different formats, which can be a time consuming process, the covenant contains an exception allowing the parties to make public statements without the need to consult with the other to the extent such disclosure is consistent with prior disclosures jointly made by the parties or made by one party with the approval of the other.  

Finally, the covenant contains an exception for the Company to communicate with its stockholders without the need to consult with Parent for matters relating to Acquisition Proposals, Superior Proposals and Changes in Recommendation.  Parent will likely require the carveout for such communications to be subject the requirements set forth in the non-solicitation covenant and also to make clear that while the Company has the freedom to make such disclosures, that freedom does not nullify any rights Parent may have with respect to the disclosure, including that disclosure may constitute a Change of Recommendation or endorsement of a Superior Proposal and permit Parent to take certain actions based thereon.

6.07.Ti=	Transfer Taxes.  

Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, all documentary, sales, use, real property transfer, registration, transfer, stamp, recording and similar Taxes, fees, and costs together with any interest thereon, penalties, fines, costs, fees, additions to tax or additional amounts with respect thereto incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, and shall file all Tax Returns related thereto that are required to be filed by Parent.

6.08.Ti=	Resignation of Directors.  

The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent prior to the Closing Date (to be effective as of the Effective Time) the resignation of each director of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (in each case, in their capacities as directors, and not as employees) as Parent shall request in writing not less than five days prior to the Closing Date.

COMMENT:

Upon completion of the Merger, the Company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.  Having resignations in hand from the directors of the Company, as well as all subsidiaries of the Company, will facilitate Parent’s ability to appoint its own directors and officers.  Because the Company does not directly control its directors, it can only request their resignations, not require them, so it is being asked only to use "commercially reasonable efforts” to obtain them. This covenant should be read together with Section 1.04, which permits Parent to appoint its nominees to the Company board of directors following consummation of the Offer in proportion to the percentage of Company Common Stock it owns, and Section 2.8 of the Agreement, which provides that the directors and officers of Purchaser will become directors and officers of the surviving corporation at the effective time.  

The Company may resist inclusion of the covenant on the grounds that it does not want to ask its directors to resign and that following consummation of the Merger, Parent will be the sole stockholder of the surviving company and will have the power to remove and replace directors (assuming the organizational documents of the surviving corporation that are put into place at closing of the Merger permit it to do so).  Parent may counter that the Company has already agreed to cause the directors to resign in connection with the appointment of Parent’s nominees at the consummation of the Offer and should be willing to do so at closing of the Merger as well. 

This provision also applies to the directors of the Company’s subsidiaries.  

Some merger agreements also seek resignations from officers, although this provision must be implemented carefully with regard to officers, particularly with respect to practical operational issues such as signatories to bank accounts.  Note also that removal of officers also must be accomplished in compliance with any applicable employment agreements (possibly including, particularly for foreign subsidiaries, employment terms imposed by applicable law).

The Company is not required to obtain resignations unless so requested by Parent.  For example, Parent might not be concerned if a group of the Company’s continuing employees continue to serve as directors of its subsidiaries.  In the case of foreign subsidiaries, where there is often a requirement for resident directors, leaving directors in place rather than finding new qualified directors may be the most practical course of action for Parent.  There are often statutory or regulatory requirements for the replacement of foreign corporation directors.

6.09.Ti=	Rule 16b-3.  

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of equity securities of the Company  in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (including derivative securities) by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company and will be subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

COMMENT:

Under U.S. securities laws, the shares of the Company held by officers and directors of the Company who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act that are exchanged for cash in the Offer or the Merger may be a disposition of their securities that could be matched against other acquisitions of Company securities within a six-month period under the Section 16 short swing profit rules promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (which under those rules could be prior to, as well as after, that disposition).  

The SEC staff provided interpretive relief against these concerns in a 1999 no-action letter (SEC letter to Skadden, Arps, Jan. 12, 1999).  That no-action letter provides that, in connection with a merger (which would include a front end tender offer pursuant to a merger agreement), the conversion of target equity securities (including derivative securities) into cash is deemed a disposition to the target (even though payment may be made by the buyer directly to target security holders) eligible for exemption under Rule 16b-3(e).

To take advantage of this exemption, specific board or compensation committee approvals are required. The SEC staff letter requires the applicable board approval be given during the period commencing with such board’s approval of the merger agreement and ending before disposition of the securities.  Such approval must contain the following:

•	The name of each officer or director;

•	The number of securities to be acquired or disposed of for each named person; and

•	That the approval is granted for purposes of exempting the transaction under Rule 16b-3.

While some parties try to take these steps relatively early in the merger process, such as at the time their respective boards approve execution of the merger agreement, it may be advisable to take these steps closer in time to the actual disposition of the Company securities, when all the information with respect to the affected individuals may be more clear.

Form 3 and Form 4 Filing Requirements.  Note that under current SEC requirements, the disposition of securities in the Offer or the Merger by the target’s directors and executive officers must be reported on Forms 4 within two business days of the disposition of Company securities.

6.10.Ti=	Rule 14d-10 Matters.  

Prior to the Acceptance Time and to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, will approve each agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by Purchaser, the Company or their respective Affiliates on or after the date hereof with any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company pursuant to which compensation is paid to such officer, director or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement” within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and to take all other action reasonably necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

[NTD:  cross-x discussion under 3.11 and expand if necessary to deal with covenant context]

COMMENT:

As discussed in the comment to Section 3.11, Rule 14d-10, which includes the "best price rule,” provides that no bidder may make a tender offer "unless . . . the consideration paid to any security holder for securities tendered. . . is the highest consideration paid to any other security holder for securities tendered. . .”  (see Exchange Act Rule 14d-10(a)(2)).  If the Company’s officers, directors and employees are also holders of the Company’s securities and tender such securities into the tender offer, there is the concern that any severance or other employee-related payments to such officers, directors and employees in connection with the consummation of the transaction might implicate Rule 14d-10 and that Purchaser would be in violation of the best-price rule if such payments were considered payments for securities tendered.  

The 2006 amendments adopted by the SEC to the best-price rule clarify that it applies only to consideration offered and paid for tendered securities and does not apply to employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangements entered into with a target’s security holders.  Payments under employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangements are outside the scope of the rule if they are both (i) for past services performed or future services to be refrained from performing and (ii) not calculated based on the number of securities tendered (see Exchange Act Rule 14d-10(d)(1)).  

The rule includes a non-exclusive safe harbor for compensatory arrangements approved by independent directors constituting a compensation committee or another committee performing functions similar to a compensation committee (or a special committee if neither such committee exists or is independent) of a target board, regardless of whether the target is a party to such arrangements, or, if Purchaser is a party to such arrangements, of the Purchaser board (see Exchange Act Rule 14d-10(d)(2)).  Section 6.10 requires the Company Board, in accordance with the non-exclusive safe harbor offered in Rule 14d-10(d)(2), to approve agreements, arrangements or understanding entered into on or after the date of the Agreement as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement” within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2).  

As drafted the covenant offers Purchaser protection against agreements, arrangements or understanding entered into after signing the Agreement, but not against those already in place and pursuant to which payments will be made in connection with the consummation of the transactions.  Accordingly, Purchaser may seek to revise the covenant to apply to agreements, arrangements or understandings that "have been or will be” entered into and pursuant to which payments are made or are to be made or benefits are granted or are to be granted.  

An alternative to expanding the scope of the covenant would be for the Company to give Purchaser a representation and warranty that  existing agreements have been approved as required to utilize the safe-harbor.  As discussed in the comment to Section 3.11, the Company would want to narrow the scope of such a representation to a specified period of time prior to the date of the Agreement, such as agreements adopted since the commencement of discussions with Purchaser, and/or a specific set of agreements, arrangements and understanding. 

Another comment that Purchaser may have in connection with this covenant is that Purchase should be given an opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the resolutions to be adopted in satisfaction of the covenant.  

6.11.Ti=	Employee Benefits.  

6.11.(1).sec=	With respect to any Benefit Plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company after the Acceptance Time, and the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time) in which any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Company Employees”) will participate effective as of or after the Acceptance Time (including any Company Benefit Plan) (such plans, the "New Benefit Plans”), Parent shall, or shall cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to, (i) recognize all service of the Company Employees with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to such time, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and accrual or entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant in any New Benefit Plan in which such Company Employees may be eligible to participate after the Acceptance Time, other than benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan, (ii) assume the liability for each Company Employee's accrued personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Company Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of the Company and (iii) honor any payments, charges and expenses of such Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) that were applied toward the deductible, out-of-pocket maximums and co-payments under a Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums and co-payments under the corresponding New Benefit Plan during the same plan year in which such payments, charges and expenses were made.

6.11.(2).sec=	From and after the Acceptance Time, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent, as applicable, shall honor, and Parent shall cause the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent, as applicable, to honor, in accordance with their terms, all individual employment, deferred compensation, severance and change of control agreements, plans or policies between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any current or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, bonuses, incentives or deferred compensation, in existence as of the Acceptance Time.

6.11.(3).sec=	From and after the Acceptance Time, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent, as applicable, shall, and Parent shall cause the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent to, provide or pay when due to any current or former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, all benefits and compensation pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans or any other compensatory programs and arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect as of the Acceptance Time earned or accrued through, and to which such individuals are entitled as of, the Acceptance Time (or such later time as such benefit plans, compensatory programs and arrangements as in effect at the Acceptance Time are terminated or canceled by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, subject to compliance with this 6.12).

6.11.(4).sec=	For a period ending two years after the Acceptance Time, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall, and Parent shall cause the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent, as applicable, to, provide to each of the Company Employees (i) salaries or wages that are no less than those paid to such Company Employee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, (ii) overall compensation that is at least substantially comparable to that provided to such Company Employee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, (iii) bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than those provided to such Company Employee by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, and (iv) employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Company Employee under the Company Benefit Plans or any other compensatory programs and arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the Acceptance Time.

6.11.(5).sec=	Nothing in this Agreement shall require the continued employment of any Company Employee after the Acceptance Time, and, except as set forth in this Section 6.12, no provision of this Agreement shall prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Company after the Acceptance Time, and the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time) from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensatory program and arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

6.11.(6).sec=	All provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to employee benefit plans or employee compensation are included for the sole benefit of the respective Parties and shall not create any third-party beneficiary or other right in any other person, including any employee or former employee of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any participant or beneficiary in any Company Benefit Plan.

6.12.Ti=	Indemnification of Officers and Directors.  

6.12.(1).sec=	All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any person who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (the "Indemnified Persons”) as provided in the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company By-Laws, the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

6.12.(2).sec=	Without limiting Section 6.13(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Person pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (a "Claim”), whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a director (including in a capacity as a member of any board committee), officer, employee or agent of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, each such Indemnified Person against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Legal Requirements), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or actual Claim.  Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Person hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent.  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Person in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Person could seek indemnification hereunder.  Parent’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations under this Section 6.13(b) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; provided, hat all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

6.12.(3).sec=	The Company may obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or "tail”) directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions) for six years from the Effective Time, covering each person who is covered by such policies on the date of this Agreement on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party than those of such policies in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the maximum aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies for any such year shall not exceed the maximum aggregate annual premium contemplated by the second succeeding sentence.  If such "tail” insurance policies have been obtained by the Company, Parent shall cause such policies to be maintained in full force and effect, for their full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by it and the Surviving Corporation.

If the Company does not obtain such "tail” insurance policies, then, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), covering each Indemnified Person on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Person than those of such policies in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance; provided, further, that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount; and provided, further, that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable and financially sound insurance company containing terms, including with respect to coverage and amounts, that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Person.

6.12.(4).sec=	In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and other assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.13.

6.12.(5).sec=	The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.13 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to whom this Section 6.13 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Person.  The provisions of this Section 6.13 are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise

6.12.(6).sec=	This Section 6.13 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and continue in full force and effect and is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Person as a third party beneficiary.

COMMENT:

This section addresses indemnification after the effective date for officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company and its subsidiaries serving in such capacities prior to the Merger.  Termination of service as an officer, director, employee or agent does not result in termination of the liabilities associated with such service.  Persons potentially affected by these liabilities would be not only those officers, directors, employees or agents at the effective date, but their predecessors as well.  

Subsection (a) is intended to provide such persons with the same rights to indemnification from specified liabilities which are incurred in connection with their official capacities as exist prior to the Merger.  These rights arise out of several sources:  charter and bylaw provisions, contractual agreements, and other undertakings creating such rights. There is no expiration of the obligations on Parent specified in clause(a) with respect to the specific organizational documents and indemnification agreements, and Parent may seek to limit the applicability of the covenant to the six-year period following the closing of the merger.

Clause (b) contains a separate indemnification obligation from Parent to the covered individuals in connection with their official duties prior to the effective time and the matters leading to the execution of the Agreement and consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.  Here the Company is seeking to provide the indemnified persons with the broadest possible indemnification, even if not provided under such persons’ current arrangements.  Such indemnification from Parent  provides broader protection to the Company directors than would be available from the Company itself, since indemnification by the Company is limited by Section 145 of the DGCL in circumstances involving, among other things, breaches of loyalty or claims by or in right of the corporation, but the indemnity by Parent would be provided by contract and so arguably not subject to such limits.  A direct undertaking from Parent also gives the indemnified persons the credit of the buyer in addition to that of the surviving corporation. 

Parent may seek to have the provision include additional detail on the indemnification procedures the covered persons must follow to avail themselves of the indemnification, such as delivering notice of the potential indemnifiable matter to Parent and allowing Parent to control the defense of the matter absence certain conflicts of interest.  In addition, Parent may seek to require the indemnified party to provide an undertaking to return any expenses advanced if it is determined that the indemnified person is determined not to be entitled to such indemnification., with such determination to be made either by independent counsel to the surviving corporation or a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subsection (c) is intended to ensure that an insurance policy is available for a certain time to protect directors and officers in the event that indemnification is not available.  Indemnification may be unavailable because (i) the contractual provisions in existence do not provide for it, (ii) it is not legally permitted or (iii) the indemnitor is insolvent.  The provisions address the concerns of the resigning executive officers and directors of the Company by requiring a policy with known coverage provisions and the concerns of Parent by limiting both the amount to be paid for such coverage and the time period during which the coverage must be maintained.

"Tail” Policies.  Historically, merger agreements have required the surviving corporation to maintain insurance covering former directors and officers during the relevant time period.  In recent years, more agreements have moved toward the purchase of a single "tail” policy.  The insurance covenant found in subsection (c) permits the Company to buy a tail policy from the Company’s existing insurer or other insurer.  A tail policy would provide coverage for a number of years after closing for acts or omissions that occurred during the period covered by the previous (pre-merger) policy.  Such a policy could provide for payment directly to the claimant rather than requiring the claimant to submit a claim through the surviving entity, eliminate the risk of non-payment of premiums, and eliminate the risk associated with applying for a new policy from a new insurer who may choose to include exclusions from coverage for certain periods, transactions, or acts.  As a practical matter, buying one multi-year tail policy also might be cheaper than the aggregate purchase price of a series of one-year insurance policies covering the same period.  

The Company and its directors will want to purchase a tail policy to avoid issues with indemnification from Parent and surviving corporation, and will want to do so prior to the Acceptance Time so as to ensure all of the directors can participate in making the determination of the tail policy to purchase.

Subsequent Corporate Events.  Clause (d) ensures that the obligations imposed on Parent in Section 6.13 will survive any future changes of control or transfers of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent by imposing a requirement that the successors of Parent assume the obligations. This provision, coupled with the third party beneficiary provision described below, is necessary to ensure the indemnified persons are able to enjoy the protections afforded by the covenant in light of subsequent corporate changes. 

Enforcement as Third Party Beneficiaries.  Because the target officers and directors are not parties to the Agreement, they need a mechanism for enforcing the provisions of this section.  Clause (e)  provides this mechanism by providing that the target officers and directors are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of, and entitled to enforce, this section.

6.13.Ti=	Purchaser Compliance.  

Parent shall cause Purchaser to comply promptly with all of Purchaser’s obligations under this Agreement and Purchaser shall not engage in any activities of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by this Agreement.

COMMENT:

The requirement that Parent cause Merger Sub to comply with the Agreement is arguably not needed as Merger Sub will be a party to the Agreement and the Company will have direct rights of enforcement against it. However, the provision recognizes that Parent is the sole stockholder of Merger Sub and can easily cause Merger Sub to comply with the Agreement, in addition to giving the Company a direct cause of action against Parent for Merger Sub’s actions.  In addition, the covenant also requires Parent to cause Merger Sub not to undertake any actions except as contemplated by the Agreement, which is intended to ensure that Merger Sub will be capable of consummating the Offer and the Merger when the conditions to each are satisfied and will have a contracts or liabilities preventing it from doing so.

6.14.Ti=	Takeover Laws; Advice of Changes.  

If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and the members of their respective boards of directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.15.Ti=	Financing.



COMMENT:

Purchaser Financing Covenant



Should it be contemplated that the purchaser will obtain debt financing in connection with the transaction (typically through a debt commitment letter as discussed in the Comment to Section 4.08), the target will typically require the purchaser to covenant to use certain efforts (ideally, "reasonable best efforts”) to obtain the committed debt financing on the terms set forth in the commitment letter. The financing covenant also typically includes the purchaser’s agreement:



•	not to permit any modification of the terms of the financing commitments without the target’s consent, subject to certain limited exceptions (such as adding or replacing lenders),



•	to maintain the financing commitment letters in effect and comply with all obligations thereunder,



•	to enter into definitive agreements for the debt financing (sometimes within a specified number of days of signing the agreement); 



•	to notify the target if certain events (such as default) occur under the debt financing commitment letter, 



•	to obtain alternative financing (generally, on terms not materially less favorable to the purchaser) if the original financing contemplated by the financing commitment letters becomes unavailable. 



One component of the covenant to obtain the financing under the financing commitment letters is that the buyer generally agrees to use reasonable efforts (or a similar standard) to enforce its rights under the commitment letters



The following is an example of a financing covenant that could be proposed by the target:

"Financing.

6.15.(1).sec=	Upon the terms and subject to conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and to do or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) described in the Commitment Letter, and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver 

(x) reduces (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount unless the Financing is increased by a corresponding amount or the Financing is otherwise made available to fund such fees or original issue discount), 

(y) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the Commitment Letter, in a manner materially adverse to Parent, Purchaser or the Company or 

(z) otherwise be reasonably likely to (i) prevent or materially adversely affect the ability of Parent to fund its obligations at the Offer Acceptance Time and the Closing Date or (ii) materially adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto. 

Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or replacement.  For purposes of this Section 6.15, references to "Financing” shall include the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section 6.15(a) and references to "Commitment Letter” shall include such documents as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section 6.15(a). 

6.15.(2).sec=	Each of Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to 

(i)	maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, 

(ii)	negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contained in the Commitment Letter (or on other terms not materially less favorable to Parent or Purchaser and that do not materially impair the ability of Parent and Purchaser to fund their obligations at the Offer Acceptance Time and the Closing Date), 

(iii)	satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding in the Commitment Letter and such definitive agreements thereto and to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Offer acceptance time and the Closing Date, as applicable, including using its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other persons committing to fund the Financing at the Offer acceptance time and on the Closing, as applicable (the "Financing Sources”), 

(iv)	enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and such definitive agreements in the event of a breach by the Financing Sources, including by seeking specific performance of the parties thereunder if necessary, and 

(v)	comply with its obligations under the Commitment Letter. 

Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company copies of the executed material definitive agreements for the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser shall give the Company prompt notice:

(w)	of any material breach or material default by any party to any of the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which Parent or Purchaser become aware, 

(x)	of the receipt of (A) any written notice or (B) other written communication, in each case, from any Financing Source with respect to any actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing,

(y)	of any material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment Letter or any such definitive agreement related to the Financing that would reasonably be expected to materially hinder or delay the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and 

(z)	if at any time for any reason Parent or Purchaser believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the Financing Sources contemplated by any of the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing. 

As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two (2) business days of the date the Company delivers to Parent or Purchaser a written request, Parent and Purchaser shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (w), (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence; provided, that Parent and Purchaser need not provide any information believed to be privileged.  

If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter, Parent and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof, and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to fund consummation of the Contemplated Transactions with terms and conditions not materially less favorable to Parent and Purchaser (or their Affiliates) than the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the Offer closing date.  

Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements, arrangements or understandings (including and side letters or (subject to customary redactions) fee letters) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Financing. ”

Company Financing Covenant

If the purchaser is a financial sponsor, the target’s business may be the sole or primary source of recourse for the acquisition lenders.  Even if the purchaser is a strategic the target’s business will likely provide part of the credit support for any acquisition financing.  Accordingly the purchaser will require, and it is market norm for the target to provide, a covenant from the target that it will cooperate with the purchaser in obtaining the debt financing contemplated by the debt financing commitment letter.  Post-financial crisis, purchasers are requiring more detailed and extensive requirements for the target’s assistance with the financing, driven in large part by the lenders’ insistence on detailed syndication conditions and covenants in the debt financing commitment letters.  

The target’s cooperation covenant obliges the target to use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist with the Financing, and to undertake certain specific undertakings to support this general assistance obligation. The list of specific target undertakings often includes the target’s agreement to use "reasonable best” efforts (or "commercially reasonable” efforts, or a similar formulation) to: 

•	participate in lender meetings, rating agency presentations, and bond offering road shows, and prepare related documents (bank book, rating agency presentation, and bond offering documents); 



•	execute definitive loan documents and certificates (including a solvency certificate) for closing of the financing; and 



•	obtain auditor comfort letters and legal opinions. 



The financing cooperation covenant will usually include an obligation of the target to deliver "Required Information” to start the "Marketing Period” (which is a minimum number of days that must elapse before the Offer closing to allow for the marketing of the purchaser’s financing.  These two definitions are often the most heavily negotiated of the financing-related provisions in the tender/merger agreement. In general, "Required Information” is the financial information needed by the purchaser to prepare an offering document for its debt financing. There is an important distinction between "Required Information” (which must be provided before the closing of the acquisition) and the other information and assistance required by the cooperation covenant (which usually requires only "commercially reasonable efforts” or similar standard to satisfy). For this reason, the target will want to move as many requirements as possible out of the "Required Information” definition and into the general provisions of the financing assistance covenant.



The target usually requires the purchaser to indemnify the target for any actions taken in connection with the financing and to reimburse the target for any fees and expenses that it incurs by its compliance with the cooperation covenant. The covenant also customarily makes clear that the target will not be liable for any fees or expenses related to the financing unless and until the acquisition closes. 



The following is an example of a financing assistance covenant that could be proposed by the target:

6.15.(3).sec=	"Financing Assistance.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at Parent’s sole expense, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent in connection with the Financing or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing ("Available Financing”) (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in any material respect). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon reasonable request by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to:

6.15.(3).(1).sec=	(i)	the extent reasonably necessary in connection with the Financing, make senior officers of the Company available to attend reasonable number of meetings (A) with prospective lenders, investors and ratings agencies, (B) in connection with a "roadshow”, (C) in connection with customary due diligence sessions and drafting sessions and sessions with ratings agencies, at such times as coordinated reasonably in advance thereof, 

6.15.(3).(2).sec=	(ii)	assist Parent with the preparation of customary materials for rating agency presentations, road-show presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda and similar documents (to the extent such customary materials contain disclosure reflecting or referring to the Company and its Subsidiaries) reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Financing, 

6.15.(3).(3).sec=	(iii)	furnish in a timely fashion the Company’s most recently completed audited financial statements, the Company’s interim financial statements for the Company’s current fiscal year and all other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably required for the Parent to prepare pro forma financial statements and other pro forma financial data that would be customarily included in bank information memoranda for the syndication of term loan and bridge loan commitments contemplated under the Commitment Letter (collectively, the "Required Information”); provided, that with respect to the foregoing clauses (A) through (C), no such financial statements or other information are required to be provided with respect to any of the Company or its Subsidiaries on an unconsolidated basis; 

6.15.(3).(4).sec=	(iv)	assist with the preparation of definitive financing documents and provide the financial institutions that have committed to provide the Financing (the "Financing Sources”) with reasonable access to the properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries during normal working hours (to the extent practicable) and upon reasonable notice, 

6.15.(3).(5).sec=	(v)	cause its independent registered public accounting firm to (A) consent to SEC filings and offering memoranda that include or incorporate the Company’s consolidated financial information and their reports thereon, in each case, to the extent such consent is required, (B) deliver to Parent and Parent’s board of directors and any underwriter of the Financing a customary auditor "comfort letter” to the extent such Financing constitutes a registered or 144A offering of debt securities, (C) reasonable assistance in the preparation of pro forma financial statements by the Parent and (D) provide reasonable assistance and cooperation to Parent, including attending customary accounting due diligence sessions, 

6.15.(3).(6).sec=	(vi)	only to the extent required in connection with the Financing, to permit Parent to display the logos of the Company in a format approved by the Company in materials distributed in connection with the Financing, provided, that Parent and its Affiliates comply with all reasonable instructions of the Company with respect to such display and ceases any and all such use by the Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement, 

6.15.(3).(7).sec=	(vii) 	reasonably cooperate with the Parent and the Financing Source or any of their respective agents and counsel with respect to their due diligence, including by giving access to documentation reasonably and customarily requested by persons in connection with capital markets transactions, and 

6.15.(3).(8).sec=	(viii)	provide reasonable assistance in the preparation of and executing and delivering (or using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from its advisors), and causing its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from their advisors), customary certificates, legal opinions and other documents and instruments relating to the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent as necessary and customary in connection with the Financing; 

provided, that the actions contemplated in the first sentence of this Section 6.15(c) and the foregoing clauses (a) through (i) do not (A) unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any out-of-pocket fees or expenses prior to Closing Date that are not promptly reimbursed by Parent, or (C) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any other liability or obligation in connection with the Financing or otherwise. 

6.15.(4).sec=	Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 6.15 (including expenses associated with attending meetings, presentations, road shows and due diligence presentations).  Parent and its Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, Affiliates, and representatives (collectively, the "Financing Indemnitees”) from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Available Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries).  The immediately preceding sentences of this Section 6.15(d) shall survive the consummation of the Merger and any termination of this Agreement, and is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by, the Financing Indemnitees and their respective Affiliates.  Section 6.15(d) may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Offer closing without the prior written consent of the affected Financing Indemnitee. 

ARTICLE 7

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO MERGER

7.01.Ti=	Conditions to Each Party’s Obligation to Effect the Merger.  

The respective obligation of each party hereto to effect the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions:

7.01.(1).sec=	Purchase of the Company Common Stock in the Offer.  Purchaser shall have previously accepted for payment all shares of the Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.   

7.01.(2).sec=	No Injunctions or Restraints.  No Order or other Law preventing the consummation of the Merger issued or promulgated by any Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction [NTD:  may want to limit to jurisdictions where the violation would have a material effect, or perhaps note this in commentary] shall be in effect; provided, that prior to asserting this condition, each of the parties hereto shall have complied with Section 6.05.

COMMENT:

Unlike a merger agreement, Article VII contains few conditions.  As this is a two-step transaction, the more meaningful conditions precedent to the consummation of the transaction are the conditions to the buyer’s obligation to close the Offer, contained in Annex A.  Once the Offer has been completed, Purchaser and, indirectly, Parent, will own a majority interest in the Company, the Merger will take place, barring extreme circumstances.  

As a process matter the Company stockholders may need to approve the Merger if either Section 251(h) were inapplicable or Purchaser cannot complete the Merger through a short-form merger, but since Purchaser owns a majority of the outstanding shares as obtained in the Offer, and has agreed to vote all such shares in favor of the Merger if a stockholder vote is required (see Section 6.04(b)), the outcome of the stockholder vote is not in question.  If Section 251(h) were inapplicable, consider replacing condition (a) with the following:  "If required by Law [NTD: "Law” is not defined ("Legal Requirement” is) but seems most used throughout, so I’m leaving this as "Law” expecting that someone will choose which to use and conform throughout], the Company shall have obtained the affirmative vote of the holders of a sufficient number of outstanding shares of the Company’s capital stock to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby under the Company’s Organizational Documents and the DGCL.”

ARTICLE 8

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

COMMENT:

Article VIII sets out the circumstances under which the Agreement may be terminated.  A termination section serves a number of purposes:

•	A termination section provides assurance to the parties that their obligations under the agreement will not be open-ended if the transaction is not consummated by an outside date, commonly referred to as a "drop dead” date.

•	In the event that it becomes clear that the transaction cannot be consummated, for example as a result of the failure of the tender offer to attract sufficient shares or the entry of a final order by a regulatory body prohibiting the transaction, the termination section will permit a party to terminate the agreement prior to the drop dead date.

•	A target will seek to negotiate provisions in the termination section to preserve flexibility for the target board to comply with its fiduciary duties.  [NTD:  Seems strong if termination right not actually required by fiduciary duties.]

•	The termination section may provide for a termination fee and/or in some instances expense reimbursement in connection with or as a result of certain terminations.

•	The termination section identifies provisions of the agreement that will survive termination of the agreement and provides that a termination will not relieve a party of certain liabilities.

As noted in more detail in the commentary to Article 7 of the ABA Model Merger Agreement, when negotiating and drafting the termination section, counsel should be aware of the interaction between that section and the provisions relating to covenants and closing conditions (in the case of the Model Agreement both for the Offer and the Merger).

In general, these termination rights are exercisable by Parent and the Company, and only require Purchaser to join in the instance of mutual consent where all the Parties are essentially amending the agreement,  consistent with the requirements of Section 9.05(a) of the Model Agreement that all Parties join in such amendment. 

8.01.Ti=	Termination.  

This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and the Merger may be abandoned (with respect to Sections 8.01(b) through 8.01(i), by written notice by the terminating Party to the other Party):

8.01.(1).sec=	by mutual written consent of Parent, [Purchaser] and the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time;

8.01.(2).sec=	by either Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time and after  [__________] (the "Outside Date”) if the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or before the Outside Date, provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(b) shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation [material]3 breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement has caused or resulted in the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur on or before the Outside Date;

8.01.(3).sec=	by either Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or ruling or taken any other nonappealable final action, in each case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of, and payment for, shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or consummation of the Merger; provided, that a Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) if a [material]4 breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement by such Party (or any Affiliate of such Party) has caused or resulted in the issuance of any such order, decree, ruling or other action;

8.01.(4).sec=	by Parent or the Company if the Offer (as it may have been extended pursuant to Section 1.01(d)) expires as a result of the non-satisfaction of the Minimum Condition, without Purchaser having accepted for payment any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer; provided, that a Party hereto shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) if a [material]5 breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement by such Party (or any Affiliate of such Party) has caused or resulted in the non-satisfaction of the Minimum Condition;

8.01.(5).sec=	by Parent, prior to the acceptance for payment of any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, if:  

8.01.(5).(1).sec=	(i)	the Company Board shall have failed to recommend the tender of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer in the Schedule 14D-9 [or approval of the Merger or adoption of this Agreement in the Proxy Statement] or shall have effected a Change in Recommendation; 

8.01.(5).(2).sec=	(ii)	the Company Board shall have adopted, approved or recommended any Acquisition Proposal (other than the Offer and the Merger); or 

8.01.(5).(3).sec=	(iii)	a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been commenced (other than by the Parent or an Affiliate of Parent) and the Company Board shall have recommended that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or, within 10 business days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, the Company Board shall have failed to recommend against acceptance of such offer 

(each of clauses (i) through (iii), a "Trigger Event”); provided, that any such termination must occur within five (5) business days of the Trigger Event;

8.01.(6).sec=	by the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in the event that (i) in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall have effected a Change in Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.02(b), and (ii) concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, the Company pays Parent the Termination Fee contemplated by Section 8.03(a) and enters into the definitive agreement to consummate the transaction contemplated by such Superior Proposal;

8.01.(7).sec=	by Parent, prior to the acceptance for payment of any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in clauses (b) or (c) of Annex I not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall not have been cured within 20 business days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from the Parent; provided that neither Parent nor Purchaser is then in [material]6 breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement;

8.01.(8).sec=	by the Company, prior to the acceptance for payment of any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform shall have had or is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect and shall not have been cured within 20 business days following receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from the Company; provided that the Company is not then in [material]7 breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement; or

8.01.(9).sec=	by the Company (A) if, for any reason, Purchaser shall have failed to commence the Offer by the date that is 10 business days after the date of this Agreement or (B) upon two (2) business days notice to Parent, if, for any reason, Purchaser shall have failed to [purchase] all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) as of the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended).  [NTD:  Distinguish "purchase” from occurrence of Acceptance Time, etc.]

COMMENT:

Timing of Termination.  If the Offer closes and Purchaser acquires a majority of the Company shares, it is in the mutual interest of the Parent and the Company shareholders for the Merger to be consummated as quickly as possible (for the Parent to eliminate concerns of dealing with minority holders and for the Company shareholders to receive the agreed upon consideration for their shares rather than being locked into a minority position) and all Parties should be committed to making that occur.  Thus, the termination rights under the Model Agreement are available only prior to the consummation of the Offer.  [For the same reason, the agreement provides for only limited conditions to the closing of the merger, as opposed to the conditions to the closing of the offer.  See Article VII and Annex A.]

The Model Agreement uses two different formulations for consummation of the Offer:  

•	The Acceptance Time, defined in Section 1.04(a) as the time upon which Purchaser has both accepted for payment, and paid for, shares of Company stock tendered into the Offer, is the end time for termination rights that are mutual or at the Company’s election.  [NTD:  Distinguish (h)?]

•	The acceptance for payment of shares in the Offer, without regard to the time of payment, is the end time for termination rights that are available only to Parent.  

[NTD:  Describe when/how shares are "paid for” in a tender offer.]

Although Purchaser is obligated under the securities laws to promptly pay for shares accepted for payment, there is at least a theoretical risk that such payment will not in fact be made.  Therefore, termination rights accorded exclusively to Parent eliminate any such risk (or potential out for Parent if it cannot pay) by being exercisable only prior to acceptance for payment, while mutual rights or those accorded exclusively to the Company may be exercised until payment is actually made.

Bases for Termination.  In light of the consequences tied to the termination rights, it is important to understand the bases for termination, each of which is discussed below.

Mutual Consent.  Pursuant to Section 8.01(a), at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, all of the Parties may jointly agree to terminate the agreement. 

"Drop Dead” Date.  Section 8.01(b) sets a date beyond which either Parent or the Company may call off the deal.  This provision is not intended to establish a target for the closing date; rather, it is designed to provide an outside date beyond which a further investment of the Parties’ resources, and the distractions and uncertainties arising from a significant transaction, may not be justified without a renegotiation of the terms of the transaction.

See the commentary to Article 7 of the ABA Model Merger Agreement for a discussion of the factors to consider in determining a drop dead date and the potential alternative provisions to extend this date if required to obtain regulatory approvals.  [NTD:  Note potential difference in timing between tender and merger, if not delayed for regulatory or other reasons]

The Model Agreement provides that the right to terminate on or after the drop dead date is not available to a Party whose material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement has caused or resulted in the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur.  [NTD:  Add example, e.g., Purchaser’s failure of HOHW]  See the discussion below under "Limitation on Termination Right.”  If a Party willfully breaches its obligations, however, Section 8.02 preserves the rights of the Party who has performed to pursue remedies for breach in the event the agreement is terminated.  [NTD:  Discuss use of "principal cause” formulation rather than just "cause”]

Court or Government Action Blocking the Merger.  The basis for termination provided in Section  8.01(c) arises when a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental body has taken an action that effectively blocks, or a legal requirement exists that precludes the consummation of, the Offer or the Merger. Similar to Section 8.01(a), this provision does not permit a Party to terminate if its (or its Affiliates) material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement has caused or resulted in the taking of such action or issuance of such order.  See the discussion below under "Limitation on Termination Right.”  

See the commentary to Article 7 of the ABA Model Merger Agreement for a discussion of whether this termination right should be limited to specified courts or governmental bodies.

Failure of the Offer to Satisfy the Minimum Condition.  If insufficient shares have been tendered into the Offer as of the expiration date (as it may be extended), Section 8.01(d) permits either Parent or the Company to terminate the agreement.  This is the equivalent of a termination right in the context of a one-step merger transaction when the stockholders of the target fail to approve the transaction at a stockholder meeting called for that purpose.  Accordingly, this termination right relates solely to the failure to meet the Minimum Condition, and not any other condition to the Offer.  If some other condition to the Offer is not met, it could give rise to a termination right under another provision of Section 8.01.  Since Purchaser is required under Section 1.01(d) to extend the Offer until the Outside Date if any condition is not met upon any earlier scheduled expiration, it will likely be the case that Sections 8.01(b) and (d) will have the same practical effect.  However, if the obligations to extend the offer in Section 1.01(d) did not run to the Outside Date then these termination provisions will differ in application.

The right to terminate under Section 8.01(d) is not available to a Party if a material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement by such Party (or any Affiliate of such Party) has caused or resulted in the non-satisfaction of the Minimum Condition.  See the discussion below under "Limitation on Termination Right.”  

Failure to Make or Change in Recommendation, Approval of Alternative Transaction or Failure to Recommend Against Competing Offer.  The termination rights in Section 8.01(e) are available only to Parent and are based upon the Company Board taking, or failing to take, specified actions that may indicate that it no longer supports or is reconsidering its support of the transaction.  These include the failure to recommend in favor of the Offer and the Merger, any change in such recommendation, approval or recommendation of any other acquisition transaction, or the failure to recommend against any competing tender offer within 10 business days.  The last action resulting in a termination right is based upon Rule 14e-2, which requires a target board to make a recommendation with respect to a tender offer within 10 business days of the commencement of such offer.   

Section 8.01(e) requires that this termination right must be exercised, if at all, within five business days of the action or failure to act resulting in the termination right.  Parent may object to the requirement to exercise its termination right within this short window period.

When considering the implications of this basis for termination, one should also carefully review Section 5.02 (and, more specifically, the definition of "Change in Recommendation”).  The termination rights given to the acquirer as a result of actions or inactions of the target board in Section 7.1(e) of the ABA Model Merger Agreement are much broader; see Section 7.1(e) and the related commentary for a discussion of alternatives that Parent and the Company may seek to negotiate.

Fiduciary Termination Right.  As a seller favorable draft, the Model Agreement includes a fiduciary termination right in Section 8.01(f) pursuant to which the Company may terminate the agreement to enter into an alternate agreement to consummate a more favorable transaction, provided that it pays to Parent the termination fee set forth in Section 8.03.

While the Company Board must be free to meet its disclosure obligations under securities laws, including Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2, and Delaware law, such obligations do not require that the Company have the right to terminate the agreement and enter into a transaction that the Company Board has determined is more favorable.  See the commentary to Section 7.1(i) of the ABA Model Merger Agreement for a discussion of the alternatives to the termination right in Section 8.01(f), as well as positions that Parent and the Company may assert in negotiating this termination right. [NTD: Should commentary be expanded and go into more detail about requirements and possible issues?] 

Inaccurate Representations/Warranties or Breaches of Covenants by the Company.  The basis for termination provided in Section 8.01(g) is available only to Parent.  It arises in the event of inaccuracies in the Company’s representations and warranties and in the event of breaches of the Company’s covenants that, in either case, excuse consummation of the Offer for failure to meet the conditions in clauses (b) or (c) of Annex I to the Model Agreement, and are not cured within 20 business days after written notice of such inaccuracy or breach has been provided to the Company.  A materiality limitation on this right is introduced by the references to clauses (b) and (c) of Annex I, which include materiality qualifications for both such inaccuracies and breaches.  The cure period is also favorable to the Company, requiring written notice before the period commences and the cure period must run even if the inaccuracy or breach is not curable.  In addition, the termination right is subject to the further limitation that Parent is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant.  See the discussion below under "Limitation on Termination Right.”  

See Section 7.1(f) of the ABA Model Merger Agreement for a termination provision in the context of a one-step merger that is much more favorable to the acquirer, as well as commentary discussing alternatives that Parent and the Company may seek to negotiate.

Inaccurate Representations/Warranties or Breaches of Covenants by Parent.  Section 8.01(h) provides the Company a reciprocal right to terminate as granted to Parent under Section 8.01(g), except the breach by Parent is tied to the interference with or delay in consummating the transaction or compliance with Parent’s obligations under the agreement rather than the closing conditions of the Offer and has a prospective element ("shall have had or is reasonably likely to have”).  The cure period and absence of breach by the terminating Party are the same as in Section 8.01(g).

Failure to Commence or Consummate Offer. Section 8.01(i) provides the Company the right to terminate if Purchaser shall have failed to commence the Offer or shall have failed to purchase shares validly tendered upon the expiration of the Offer.   As a seller friendly draft this termination right does not include any limitation upon the exercise of this right if the Company’s breach contributed to such failure.  

Parent may also seek to clarify that clause (B) would not apply if Purchaser’s failure to purchase is the result of one or more conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex I not being satisfied as of the expiration of the Offer.  [While the requirement in Section 1.01(d) of the Model Agreement that the Offer be extended until the Outside Date in the event all conditions are not met or waived means that either party could also terminate under Section 8.01(b) in such event, a different extension provision in Section 1.01(d) would make such a change more meaningful.]

Limitation on Termination Right.  The termination rights in Sections 8.01(b), (c), (d), (g) and (h) each require that the terminating Party (and in certain cases its Affiliates as well) not be in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under the agreement in order to exercise the termination right.  In many instances where a termination of an agreement may be threatened, disputes may arise regarding possible breaches of the agreement by the terminating party that caused or contributed to the circumstances giving rise to the termination right.  As a seller friendly draft, this limitation is included in most of the termination rights on the theory that more of the termination rights are in favor of Parent and more often Parent will be seeking to assert termination rights even where the right is mutual.  It is not included in Sections 8.01(e), (f) or (i) since these provisions involve more specific actions or inactions that are specifically required or permitted under the Model Agreement where the conduct of the terminating Party is likely irrelevant, although as noted above Purchaser could seek to incorporate this concept into Section 8.01(i).

Conceptually, this limitation should be applied in a uniform manner, although the parties could seek to distinguish among the provisions.  The seller may prefer to delete the materiality qualifier in this limitation, especially where the seller is concerned that the acquirer may be much more likely to seek to terminate the deal as a business matter than the seller.  For the same reason the acquirer may seek to include a materiality qualifier and/or to include some additional qualification such as that the breach was the ‘primary’ or ‘principal’ reason that the circumstances triggering the termination right arose.  

8.02.Ti=	Effect of Termination.  

In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect; provided, that this Section 8.02, Section 8.03 and Article IX [other?] shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect; and provided, further, that the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any Party from any liability for fraud or willful breach.  [NTD:  Do we want to add a definition of willful breach to the Model Agreement?  NTD:  YES, AND ADD COMMENTARY AS TO COURT VIEWS, E.G. GUIDANT]]

COMMENT:

Section 8.02 provides that termination of the agreement does not affect the negotiated rights and obligations of the Parties under Section 8.03 relating to expense reimbursement and termination fees [or other provisions that the Parties have agreed will survive such termination].  

Section 8.02 also provides that termination will not relieve a Party from any liability for fraud or willful breach of the agreement.  In other words, even if the agreement is terminated under circumstances in which an expense reimbursement or termination fee payment obligation of the Company is triggered, the payment of these amounts will not release the Company from liability to Parent for any additional loss or damage that it has suffered, if the loss or damage results from the Company’s fraud or willful breach.  

[NTD:  Note need for provision to avoid extinguishing breach claims if one party terminates; also, note impact on determination of other damages if termination fee/expense reimbursement provided separately; and relationship to pursuit of specific performance of the agreement] 

See the commentary to Section 7.2 of the ABA Model Merger Agreement for a discussion of the various interpretations a court may give to "willful” and for alternatives that Parent and the Company may seek to negotiate.

8.03.Ti=	Expenses; Termination Fees.  

8.03.(1).sec=	Except as set forth in this Section 8.03, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated; provided, that the Company agrees to pay Parent (or its designees) an amount equal to $_________ (the "Termination Fee”) if this Agreement is terminated:

8.03.(1).(1).sec=	by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(e); or

8.03.(1).(2).sec=	by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f).

8.03.(2).sec=	Any Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to Section 8.03(a) shall be paid within two business days after termination by Parent or the Company, as the case may be.

COMMENT:

A provision for the payment of fees (and for reimbursement of expenses) is a common provision in acquisition transactions involving public companies.  As a seller friendly draft, the Model Agreement provides only for the payment of a termination fee, and not for any expense reimbursement.  In addition, the termination fee is payable only upon the Company Board taking an action, or failing to take an action, that triggers a termination right in favor of Parent under Section 8.01(e) or if the Company terminates under Section 8.01(f) to enter into an agreement to consummate an alternative transaction. 

See Section 7.3 of the ABA Model Merger Agreement and the related commentary for alternative termination fee and expense reimbursement provisions, as well as a discussion regarding considerations relating to the size and computation of such amounts.  In particular, Parent may seek a termination fee in the event the agreement is terminated under Sections 8.01(b) or (g) and within a specified period of time the Company consummates an alternative acquisition transaction with a third party.

Timing of Payments.  The timing of the reimbursement and termination fee payments is addressed in Section 8.03(b).  The agreement provides that the Company must pay the termination fee within two business days of termination. 

Parent may seek to require that the Company pay any fee triggered by the Company terminating under Section 8.01(f) as a prerequisite to the termination; that is, the fee must be paid at the time of termination rather than two days thereafter.

9.16.Ti=	Certain Definitions:  

"Acceptance Time” means the acceptance for payment of any shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer.

COMMENT:

Section 251(h) is designed to minimize the delay between closing of the front-end tender offer and the back-end merger.  If the front-end tender offer and the back-end merger can close virtually simultaneously then, among other things, the bidder may be able to utilize the assets of the target as collateral for its debt financing.

In order to effect a Section 251(h) merger, the front-end tender offer must be "consummated.”  Although Section 801.33 of the HSR Act contains a definition of "consummation” ("the acceptance for payment of any shares tendered in a tender offer”), neither the SEC nor the DGCL contains such a definition.  

Because the concept of "Acceptance Time” may be viewed as a proxy for the term "consummate,” parties may consider defining Acceptance Time as the "acceptance of payment” without referring to the "payment by Purchaser for” shares, as is reflected in the language above.

However, particularly in a non-Section 251(h) transaction, "Acceptance Time” may be defined as the time when Purchaser accepts for payment and pays for the tendered shares.  Under this definition, Purchaser and Parent would not become entitled to designate directors under Section 1.04 until after Purchaser actually pays for the tendered shares on the theory that it is not until that time that Purchaser actually achieves ownership of such shares and becomes entitled to the corresponding rights of a stockholder.  [NTD:  Add commentary as to whether purchaser would propose standard of acceptance, without regard to actual payment.]

"Acquiring Person” shall have the meaning set forth in Section 3.22.

"Acquisition Proposal” means any offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of interest (other than an offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of interest by Parent or Purchaser) contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction.

"Acquisition Transaction” means any transaction or series of transactions involving:

(a)	any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities, acquisition of securities, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar transaction (i) in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a constituent corporation, (ii) in which a Person or "group” (as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) of Persons directly or indirectly acquires beneficial or record ownership of securities representing more than 20% of the outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries issues or sells securities representing more than 20% of the outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or

(b)	any sale (other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business), lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer (other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business), license (other than nonexclusive licenses in the ordinary course of business), acquisition or disposition of any business or businesses or assets that constitute or account for 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

COMMENT:

Because this Model Agreement is governed by Section 251(h) and no stockholder vote to approve the back-end merger is necessary, the Board Recommendation relates only to tendering shares into the Offer.  If Section 251(h) were inapplicable, consider defined Board Recommendation to mean "the recommendation of the Company Board that the holders of the Company Common Stock accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and to vote to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders’ Meeting.”

"Book Entry Shares” mean uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by a book entry.

ANNEX A

CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.  Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, pay for any shares of the Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, and, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, may amend or terminate the Offer, unless, at the time of expiration of the Offer:

COMMENT:

Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, as referenced in the preamble to the conditions, requires Purchaser to pay for or return tendered shares of the Company Common Stock promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer.

It is important to include a statement in the preamble to the conditions of the offer on the timing of the satisfaction of the conditions.  Specifying that the conditions must be satisfied at the time of the expiration of the Offer assures the Purchaser that all the conditions to the Offer are satisfied before there is an obligation to purchase the Shares of Company Common Stock.  If such a statement is not included, the Purchaser could be in the position of having to purchase the Company Common Stock if the conditions were satisfied at any time prior to the expiration of the Offer, even if they were no longer satisfied at such time.

(i)	there shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of shares of the Company Common Stock that, together with shares of the Company Common Stock already owned by Purchaser, would represent at least a majority of the outstanding Company Common Stock (the "Minimum Tender Condition”) (for purposes of determining whether the Minimum Tender Condition has been satisfied, Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee shall not be considered validly tendered and not withdrawn), and    

COMMENT:

Minimum Tender Condition.  Section 251(h) requires that, following consummation of the Offer, Purchaser "own” at least that percentage of shares as would be required to vote to adopt the Merger Agreement if Section 251(h) were inapplicable.  By statute, that vote requirement is a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the merger.  However, a company’s charter may include a higher vote threshold.

In non-Section 251(h) deals, in determining the number of shares that must be tendered to satisfy the Minimum Tender Condition, the parties should consider whether to use a denominator based on either:

(i)	the shares actually outstanding, or

(ii)	the fully diluted, or some variation of the diluted, shares outstanding (that is, reflecting the potential for shares that may be issued to options and other derivative or contingent rights).

Using the outstanding amount would decrease the number of shares required to satisfy the Minimum Tender Condition and therefore make it more likely that the Minimum Tender Condition would be met.  However, closing on just a majority of the outstanding shares might expose a purchaser to the risk that prior to the vote on the back-end merger or the time of determination of whether the purchaser holds enough shares to allow the purchaser to effect a short-form merger, more Company shares might be issued, such as pursuant to outstanding options, so that the purchaser no longer holds a majority of the outstanding shares.  [NTD:  Note why not this is not an issue in 251(h) deals.]

While the most common threshold has been the fully-diluted shares number, variations exist, such as counting only those derivative securities that are likely to be vested at the time of the shareholder meeting or short-form merger, or counting only those securities that are "in the money” based on the Offer price.

If a fully diluted concept is used, one potential definition is as follows:  

"The term "Fully Diluted Shares” means all outstanding securities entitled generally to vote in the election of directors of the Company on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the exercise or conversion of all Options, rights and securities convertible or exercisable into such voting securities on or prior to the Closing Date (other than the Top-Up Option).”  

This definition limits the time parameters to include only those shares that could in fact be issued upon conversion or exercise during the relevant time frame.  Alternatively, the definition could instead include all shares issuable upon conversion or exercise, regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof.

Requirement of Purchaser Ownership.  Another consideration is that under each of Section 251(h), Section 253 and Section 267 of the DGCL, Purchaser must "own” 90% of the Company’s shares.  The DGCL generally defines "ownership” as record ownership.  Accordingly, purchasers generally coordinate in advance with the Company’s transfer agent to transfer ownership of the shares to Purchaser on the transfer agent’s records in connection with the closing of the tender offer.  Also for this reason, Parent should transfer to Purchaser any shares of the Company it may own.  Finally, shares delivered by notice of guaranteed delivery should be excluded.

(ii)	any waiting period applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated.

COMMENT:  

The proposed merger, unless an exception is available under the HSR Act, will require the submission of a HSR filing if the relevant thresholds are satisfied.  Both Purchaser and the Company are required to make separate filings.  Once the filings are made, the waiting period begins.  The waiting period is normally 30 days but is 16 days for cash tender offers.  For additional discussion regarding the HSR Act, see the commentary to Article 4 of the ABA Model Merger Agreement.

Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment or, subject as aforesaid, to pay for any shares of the Company Common Stock not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for if, at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and before the expiration of the Offer, any of the following conditions exists and is continuing at the expiration of the Offer:

(a)	any Order or other Law preventing the consummation of the Merger issued or promulgated by any Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction (a "Government Action”) shall be in effect, provided, that Parent and Purchaser have used commercially reasonable efforts to oppose any such Government Action;

(b)	the representations and warranties of the Company (i) contained in Section 3.11(u) shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such date, and (ii) contained in the Agreement, other than Section 3.11(u), shall not be true and correct as of the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such date (except to the extent that any such representations and warranties speak as of a specified date, in which case only as of such specified date) and the failure or failures of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct has had a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

(c)	the Company shall have failed to perform in all respects its agreements and covenants to be performed or complied with by it contained in Section 6.10 and shall not have cured such breach, failure to perform or noncompliance; 

COMMENT: 

Sections (b) and (c) treat the representations and covenants regarding Rule 14d-10 matters differently than the other representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Agreement.  The Rule 14d-10 matters can be considered to be "fundamental” representations and covenants in the tender offer context.  As more fully discussed in the comments to Sections 3.11 and 6.10 above, the Rule 14d-10 references to the best price rule and the safe harbor for certain compensatory agreements are critical to the Offer [and thus are not appropriately subject to a materiality qualifier].  [NTD:  Is this always the case?]  For a more complete discussion of fundamental representations, see Comments to Section 5.1.  As this is a Seller’s first draft, the tolerance level on the bringdown of the representations and warranties is fairly high.  A more buyer-friendly formulation which strips the materiality qualifiers for purposes of the bringdown would be as follows:

"(b) the representations and warranties of the Company (i) contained in Section 3.11(u) shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such date, and (ii) contained in the Agreement, other than Section 3.11(u), shall not be true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality” or any derivative thereof or "Company Material Adverse Effect” set forth therein) as of the expiration of the Offer as if made at and as of such date (except to the extent that any such representations and warranties speak as of a specified date, in which case only as of such specified date) and the failure or failures of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality” or any derivative thereof or "Company Material Adverse Effect” set forth therein) has had a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

(c)	the Company (i) shall have failed to perform in all respects its agreements and covenants to be performed or complied with by it contained in Section 6.10 and shall not have cured such breach, failure to perform or noncompliance, and (ii) shall have failed to perform in all material respects its agreements and covenants to be performed or complied with by it under this Agreement, other than as described in clause (i) above, and shall not have cured such breach, failure to perform or noncompliance;”

The relative importance of the representations and warranties and the trigger thresholds are deal specific and are subject to extensive negotiation.

(d)	this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms; or

(e)	the occurrence of any Company Material Adverse Effect.

The foregoing conditions may be waived by Purchaser and Parent in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (other than the Minimum Tender Condition).  The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

COMMENT:

The conditions to the Offer are events that must occur or circumstances that must exist before Parent is obligated to accept any shares of the Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer.  If any of the conditions in Annex A are not satisfied, then Parent may decline to proceed with the Offer and the Merger until the conditions are satisfied and, under certain circumstances, may terminate the Agreement in accordance with Article VIII.

Purchasers may attempt to make their obligation to close an Offer subject to as many conditions as possible and will negotiate a variety of conditions that provide them with an opportunity to decline to complete the Offer.  Conversely, targets generally desire to limit the conditions to a Purchaser’s obligation to close.  A target wants to assure that the transaction is closed as negotiated, and further is concerned that announcement of the transaction has the potential to affect adversely the target’s business and constituents.  Failure to close or even uncertainty as to closing may disrupt the target’s relationships with its executives, employees, suppliers, customers and stockholders.  Such disruption could leave the target weaker than it was before the transaction was announced.  Targets also strive to minimize a Purchaser’s closing conditions because, if Purchaser refuses to consummate the transaction on the basis that a closing condition is not fulfilled, the target may be viewed as "damaged goods” and this may negatively affect its ability to merge with another buyer or its ability to obtain a fair price in another merger.  Purchasers may also be concerned with deal protection, particularly if the transaction is strategic or transformational to Purchaser.

Scope and Waiver of Conditions of the Offer.  The conditions of the offer vary from deal to deal and there is no "correct” set of closing conditions.  However, the conditions that may be used for a tender offer are limited in comparison to the conditions that may be used for the closing of a merger or stock purchase.  In the non-tender offer situation, the parties generally negotiate conditions to closing without regulatory intervention, allowing the parties to set any conditions they deem desirable.  In the tender offer context, however, the SEC may limit the conditions that can be used. 

The SEC provides some guidance regarding the scope of any conditions to a tender offer.  

•	A tender offer may be conditioned on a variety of events and circumstances, provided that they are not within the direct or indirect control of the bidder.  

•	The conditions must be drafted with sufficient specificity to allow for an objective verification of whether or not the conditions have been satisfied.  If there are conditions in a tender offer where the determination of whether or not a condition has been triggered is in the sole judgment of the bidder, such a condition may render the Offer to be considered "illusory,” that is, providing the bidder a right to refuse to consummate the offer at its own discretion.  In addition, the SEC has advised that broadly drafted conditions can make it impossible for a security holder to determine what events or occurrences will allow the bidder to terminate the offer.  

•	Conditions that may be triggered at any time and for any reason also may cause the offer to be considered illusory.  For example, the SEC commented unfavorably upon a tender offer condition that stated that there shall not have occurred "the commencement or escalation of a war, armed hostilities or other international or national crisis directly or indirectly involving the United States,” cautioning that the cited language lacked specificity in the type of international crises that would trigger the condition.  

•	The SEC has determined that illusory offers contravene the prohibitions against fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative acts or practices within the meaning of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act.  See In re Pabst Brewing Co. & APL Corp., CCH Blue Sky L. Rep. ¶ 71,415 (Wis. Comm’r Sec. 1978).  

The Agreement does not provide an exhaustive list of all possible closing conditions, but does include closing conditions that are frequently seen in offers of this type.  Some additional conditions that may merit consideration for inclusion in the Agreement are as follows:

•	Financing.  Purchaser has been unable, prior to the expiration of the Offer, to obtain financing [pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter and otherwise] reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that will be sufficient for Purchaser to acquire all of the Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer[ and pay related fees and expenses].

•	Suspension of Trading.  There shall have occurred (i) any general suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices for, securities on any national securities exchange of in the over-the-counter market in the United States, (ii) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States (whether or not mandatory), or (iii)  any significant adverse change in the market price of the Company Common Stock or in the securities or financial markets of the United States.

•	No Other Tender Offers.  (a) A tender or exchange offer for some or all of the shares of Company Common Stock has been publicly proposed to be made or has been made by another person (including the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates), or has been publicly disclosed, or (b) any person or group has entered into a definitive agreement or an agreement in principle or made a proposal with respect to a tender or exchange offer or a merger, consolidation or other business combination with or involving the Company.

•	[SEC Approval.  The SEC has not confirmed to Purchaser and Company that it has completed its review of, and has no further comments on, the Schedule TO and related Schedule 14D-9.]  [NTD:  How common is this in the tender offer context?]

Parent may elect to pay for any shares of the Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer despite the non-fulfillment of a Condition of the Offer.  Parties often agree that their closing conditions may only be waived in writing to avoid disputes about whether a party has actually waived a closing condition.  See Comment to Section 8.2(b).

For additional discussion regarding the application and drafting of each of these conditions, see Article 5 of the ABA Model Merger Agreement.

Waiver of Conditions.  The Agreement provides that the conditions can be waived at any time by Purchaser and that the failure to exercise any rights in the conditions shall not be deemed to be a waiver of these rights.  However, the SEC has taken the position that if a condition is triggered and Purchaser proceeds with Offer, Purchaser has waived the condition.  As such, Purchaser should bear in mind that any waiver of a condition must be communicated and confirmed formally and not through its conduct.  Thus, depending on the materiality of the condition and the time until expiration of the Offer, Purchaser may need to extend the Offer and circulate revised tender offer materials to security holders.

Financing Condition.  [A Purchaser’s Offer extension often relates to the financing condition.]  The SEC has articulated the position that a material change in the Offer occurs when the financing condition is satisfied.  Thus the SEC would require that the Offer should remain open for at least five days following satisfaction.  This requirement can prove problematic as the definitive terms for the financing often are not finalized until the last moment.  In that particular case, the Offer period would need to be extended.  In the case of a firm, legally binding commitment for financing, Purchaser could argue that the financing condition is not a "true” financing condition and thus may be able to avoid the extension of the Offer.
