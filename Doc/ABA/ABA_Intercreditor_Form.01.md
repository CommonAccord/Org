1.10.Ti=RELEASE OF LIENS [OR GUARANTIES]

1.10.1.sec=If First Lien Agent releases a Lien on Collateral[, or releases a Grantor from its Obligations under its guaranty of the First Lien Obligations which guaranty is secured by a Lien on Collateral,] in connection with:

1.10.1.1.sec=an Enforcement Action, or

1.10.1.2.sec=a Disposition of any Collateral under the First Lien Loan Documents other than pursuant to an Enforcement Action (whether or not there is an event of default under the First Lien Loan Documents),

then any Lien of Second Lien Agent on such Collateral[, and the Obligations of the Grantor under such guaranty of the Second Lien Obligations,] will be, except as otherwise provided below, automatically and simultaneously released to the same extent, and Second Lien Agent will promptly execute and deliver to First Lien Agent [or the Grantor] such termination statements, releases, and other documents as First Lien Agent [or the Grantor] requests to effectively confirm the release, provided that such release will not occur without the consent of Second Lien Agent

(x)	for an Enforcement Action, as to any Collateral the net Proceeds of the disposition of which will not be applied to repay (and, to the extent applicable, to reduce permanently commitments with respect to) the First Lien Obligations, or

(y)	for a Disposition, if the Disposition is prohibited by a provision of the Second Lien Credit Agreement [other than solely as the result of the existence of a default or event of default under the Second Lien Loan Documents].

1.10.2.sec=Second Lien Agent hereby appoints First Lien Agent and any officer or agent of First Lien Agent, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power and authority in the place and stead of Second Lien Agent or in First Lien Agent’s own name, in First Lien Agent’s discretion to take any action and to execute any and all documents and instruments that may be reasonable and appropriate for the limited purpose of carrying out the terms of this section 1.10, including any endorsements or other instruments of transfer or release. This appointment is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations or such time as this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

1.10.3.sec=Until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, to the extent that First Lien Agent

1.10.3.1.sec=releases a Lien on Collateral or a Grantor from its Obligations under its guaranty, which Lien or guaranty is reinstated, or

1.10.3.2.sec=obtains a new Lien or additional guaranty from a Grantor, then Second Lien Agent will be granted a Lien on such Collateral and an additional guaranty, as the case may be, subject to section 1.1, “Seniority of Liens Securing First Lien Obligations.”

1.11.Ti=SUBORDINATION OF LIENS SECURING EXCESS FIRST LIEN OBLIGATIONS

1.11.1.sec=If this Agreement provides for a Second Lien Cap, then all Liens securing Second Lien Obligations up to but not exceeding the Second Lien Cap will be senior in all respects and prior to any Lien on the Collateral securing any Excess First Lien Obligations, as defined below (but only with respect to such excess amounts), and all Liens securing any Excess First Lien Obligations will be junior and subordinate in all respects to any Lien securing a Second Lien Obligation up to but not exceeding the Second Lien Cap. All Liens securing Excess First Lien Obligations will be senior in all respects and prior to any Lien on the Collateral securing any Excess Second Lien Obligations and all Liens securing any Excess Second Lien Obligations will be junior and subordinate in all respects and prior to any Lien securing Excess First Lien Obligations.

Example:  Suppose First Lien Obligations are $150 million, with a First Lien Cap of $100 million; Second Lien Obligations are $50 million, with a Second Lien Cap of $20 million; and the total Collateral has a fair market value of $175 million. Then First Lien Claimholders will have a first priority Lien on the first $100 million of Collateral (including Proceeds), Second Lien Claimholders will have a second priority Lien in the next $20 million of Collateral, First Lien Claimholders will have a third priority Lien in the remaining $55 million of Collateral up to the $50 million of Excess First Lien Obligations, and Second Lien Claimholders will have a fourth priority Lien in the remaining $5 million of Collateral. If all of the Collateral is sold at its fair market value, then the $175 million in sales proceeds will be sufficient to pay the First Lien Obligations of $150 million in full and $25 million of the Second Lien Obligations. See also section 4.1, “Application of Proceeds.”

1.11.2.sec=If this Agreement provides for a First Lien Cap but does not provide for a maximum limitation of the amount of the Second Lien Obligations (i.e., a Second Lien Cap), then all Liens securing Second Lien Obligations will be senior in all respects and prior to any Lien on the Collateral securing any Excess First Lien Obligations, as defined below (but only with respect to such excess amounts), and all Liens securing any Excess First Lien Obligations will be junior and subordinate in all respects to any Lien securing a Second Lien Obligation.

Example:  Suppose First Lien Obligations are $150 million, with a First Lien Cap of $100 million; Second Lien Obligations are $50 million with no Second Lien Cap; and the total Collateral has a fair market value of $175 million. Then First Lien Claimholders will have a first priority Lien on the first $100 million of Collateral (including Proceeds), Second Lien Claimholders will have a second priority Lien in the next $50 million of Collateral, and First Lien Claimholders will have a third priority Lien on the remaining $25 million in Collateral. If all of the Collateral is sold at its fair market value, then the $1 75 million in sales proceeds will be sufficient to pay $125 million of the First Lien Obligations of $150 million and the Second Lien Obligations totaling $50 million in full. See also section 4.1, “Application of Proceeds.”

1.11.3.sec=Excess First Lien Obligations means any First Lien Obligations that are included in the Capped Obligations and that are in excess of the First Lien Cap.

1.11.4.sec=With respect to the Excess First Lien Obligations and Collateral (including Proceeds),

1.11.4.1.sec=First Lien Claimholders will have rights and obligations (other than the obligations in respect to the Standstill Period) analogous to the rights and obligations Second Lien Claimholders have under this Agreement with respect to the Second Lien Obligations [not in excess of any Second Lien Cap] and the Collateral (including Proceeds), and

1.11.4.2.sec=Second Lien Claimholders will have rights and obligations analogous to the rights and obligations First Lien Claimholders have under this Agreement with respect to the First Lien Obligations that are included in the Capped Obligations and that are not in excess of the First Lien Cap, and the Collateral (including Proceeds).

1.11.5.sec=Nothing in this section 1.11 will waive any default or event of default under the Second Lien Loan Documents resulting from 

1.11.5.1.sec=the incurrence of Obligations under the First Lien Loan Documents in excess of the First Lien Cap with respect to the Capped Obligations, or

1.11.5.2.sec=the grant of Liens under the First Lien Collateral Documents securing any such excess amounts,

or the right of Second Lien Claimholders to exercise any rights and remedies under the Second Lien Loan Documents as a result thereof.

2.2.7.sec=for the Second Lien Obligations, modifies covenants, defaults, or events of default to make them materially more restrictive as to any Grantor, except for modifications to match changes made to the First Lien Obligations so as to preserve, on substantially similar economic terms, any differential that exists on the date hereof between the covenants, defaults, or events of default in the First Lien Loan Documents and the covenants, defaults, or events of default in the Second Lien Loan Documents;

2.2.8.sec=for the Second Lien Obligations, accelerates any date upon which a scheduled payment of principal or interest is due, or otherwise decreases the weighted average life to maturity;

2.2.9.sec=for the Second Lien Obligations, changes a prepayment, redemption, or defeasance provision so as to require a new payment or accelerate an existing payment Obligation; or

2.2.10.sec=for the Second Lien Obligations,

2.2.j.1.sec=changes a term that would result in a default under the First Lien Credit Agreement,

2.2.j.2.sec=increases the Obligations of a Grantor, or

2.2.j.3.sec=confers additional rights on a Second Lien Claimholder in a manner materially adverse to a First Lien Claimholder.

[ADDITIONAL SECTION FOR ASSET-BASED LENDING TRANSACTION]

[(*) for the First Lien Obligations, increases the Advance Rate applicable to the Borrowing Base to a rate higher than the Advance Rate on the date hereof, or modifies the definitions of “Borrowing Base,” “Eligible Account,” “Eligible Inventory,” or “Reserves” in the First Lien Credit Agreement on the date hereof so as to increase the amount of credit available to Borrower, provided that First Lien Agent’s discretion to establish additional reserves, to release reserves, and to determine eligibility will not be affected or limited in any manner.]

[END OF ADDITIONAL SECTION]

2.3.Ti=PARALLEL MODIFICATIONS TO SECOND LIEN OBLIGATIONS

Subject to Section 2.2, “Modifications Requiring Consent,” if a First Lien Claimholder and a Grantor modify a First Lien Collateral Document, the modification will apply automatically to any comparable provision of a Second Lien Collateral Document in which the Grantor grants a Lien on the same Collateral, without the consent of any Second Lien Claimholder and without any action by Second Lien Agent or any Grantor, provided that no such modification will

2.3.1.sec=remove or release Second Lien Collateral, except to the extent that (1) the release is permitted or required by section 6.1, “Use of Cash Collateral and DIP Financing,” and (2) there is a corresponding release of First Lien Collateral,

2.3.2.sec=impose duties on Second Lien Agent without its consent, [or]

2.3.3.sec=permit other Liens on the Collateral not permitted under the terms of the Second Lien Loan Documents or section 6, “Insolvency Proceedings,” of this Agreement[, or

Upon such resignation, a new administrative agent and, if applicable, a new collateral agent will be elected or appointed in accordance with the First Lien Loan Documents.

5.6.3.sec=First Lien Agent will apply cash collateral to reimburse Letter of Credit issuers for drawings under Letters of Credit, any customary fees charged by the issuer in connection with such draws, and facing or similar fees. After giving effect to each such payment, any remaining cash collateral that exceeds [105%] of the sum of the aggregate undrawn amount of all then outstanding Letters of Credit and the aggregate facing and similar fees that will accrue thereon through the stated maturity of such Letters of Credit (assuming no drawings thereon before stated maturity) will be returned to the Purchasing Creditors (as their interests appear). When all Letters of Credit have been cancelled with the consent of the beneficiary thereof, expired, or been fully drawn, and after all payments from the account described above have been made, any remaining cash collateral will be returned to the Purchasing Creditors, as their interests appear.

5.6.4.sec=If for any reason other than the gross negligence or willful misconduct of First Lien Agent, the cash collateral is less than the amount owing with respect to a Letter of Credit described in the preceding subsection (c), then the Purchasing Creditors will, in proportion to their interests, promptly reimburse First Lien Agent (who will then pay the issuing bank) the amount of the deficiency.

A First Lien Claimholder that complies with this section 5 will not be in default of this Agreement or otherwise be deemed liable for any action or inaction of any Defaulting Creditor, provided that nothing in this subsection (c) will require the Purchasing Creditors to purchase less than all of the Purchase Obligations.

5.7.4.sec=Borrower and Holdings irrevocably consent, and will use their best efforts to obtain any necessary consent of each other Grantor, to any assignment effected to one or more Purchasing Creditors pursuant to this section 5.

(D)	such DIP Financing and the Liens securing such DIP Financing are pari passu with or superior in priority to the then outstanding First Lien Obligations and the Liens securing such First Lien Obligations, and

(E)	the interest rate, fees, advance rates, lending limits, and sublimits are commercially reasonable under the circumstances.] [Upon written request from First Lien Agent, Second Lien Agent, as holder of a Lien on the Collateral, will join any objection by First Lien Agent to the use, sale, or lease of cash collateral for any purpose other than adequate protection payments to Second Lien Claimholders.]

[(b)	Any customary “carve-out” or other similar administrative priority expense or claim consented to in writing by First Lien Agent to be paid prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations up to the First Lien Cap with respect to the Capped Obligations and in their entirety with respect to First Lien Obligations that are not Capped Obligations will be deemed for purposes of section 6.1(a)

6.2.1.sec=either (i) pursuant to court order, the Liens of Second Lien Claimholders attach to the net Proceeds of the Disposition with the same priority and validity as the Liens held by Second Lien Claimholders on such Collateral, and the Liens remain subject to the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) the Proceeds of a Disposition of Collateral received by First Lien Agent in excess of those necessary to achieve the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, up to the First Lien Cap with respect to the Capped Obligations and in their entirety with respect to First Lien Obligations that are not Capped Obligations, are distributed in accordance with the U.C.C. and applicable law[,] [.]

[Upon First Lien Agent’s request, Second Lien Agent, solely in its capacity as holder of a Lien on Collateral, will join any objection asserted by First Lien Agent to any Disposition of Collateral during an Insolvency Proceeding.]

6.3.Ti=RELIEF FROM THE AUTOMATIC STAY

Until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations up to the First Lien Cap with respect to the Capped Obligations and in their entirety with respect to First Lien Obligations that are not Capped Obligations, no Second Lien Claimholder may[, during any Standstill Period,] seek relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in an Insolvency Proceeding in respect of the Collateral without First Lien Agent’s prior written consent [or oppose any request by First Lien Agent for relief from such stay] [, except to the extent that

[a First Lien Claimholder (in such capacity)] [First Lien Agent] seeks or obtains relief from or modification of such stay[, or a motion for adequate protection permitted under section 6.4, “Adequate Protection,” is denied by the Bankruptcy Court]]. 

6.4.Ti=ADEQUATE PROTECTION

6.4.1.sec=No Second Lien Claimholder will contest, protest, or object to

6.4.1.1.sec=a request by a First Lien Claimholder for “adequate protection” under any Bankruptcy Law, or

6.4.2.3.sec=Any claim by a Second Lien Claimholder under section 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code will be subordinate in right of payment to any claim of First Lien Claimholders under section 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and any payment thereof will be deemed to be Proceeds of Collateral[, provided that, subject to section 6.7, “Reorganization Securities,” Second Lien Claimholders will be deemed to have agreed pursuant to section 1 129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code that such section 507(b) claims may be paid under a plan of reorganization in any form having a value on the effective date of such plan equal to the allowed amount of such claims].

If a Second Lien Claimholder receives Second Lien Adequate Protection Payments before the Discharge of First Lien Obligations up to the First Lien Cap with respect to the Capped Obligations and in their entirety with respect to First Lien Obligations that are not Capped Obligations, then upon the effective date of any plan or the conclusion or dismissal of any Insolvency Proceeding, the Second Lien Claimholder will pay over to First Lien Agent pursuant to section 4.1, “Application of Proceeds,” an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Second Lien Adequate Protection Payments received by the Second Lien Claimholder and (ii) the amount necessary to Discharge the First Lien Obligations.

[ALTERNATIVE SECTION FAVORABLE TO SECOND LIEN LENDERS]

[END OF ALTERNATIVE SECTION]

6.6.Ti=AVOIDANCE; REINSTATEMENT OF OBLIGATIONS

If a First Lien Claimholder or a Second Lien Claimholder receives payment or property on account of a First Lien Obligation or Second Lien Obligation, and the payment is subsequently invalidated, avoided, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, or otherwise required to be transferred to a trustee, receiver, or the estate of Borrower or other Grantor (a Recovery) , then, to the extent of the Recovery, the First Lien Obligations or Second Lien Obligations intended to have been satisfied by the payment will be reinstated as First Lien Obligations or Second Lien Obligations, as applicable, on the date of the Recovery, and no Discharge of First Lien Obligations or Discharge of Second Lien Obligations, as applicable, will be deemed to have occurred for all purposes hereunder. If this Agreement is terminated prior to a Recovery, this Agreement will be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination will not diminish, release, discharge, impair, or otherwise affect the obligations of the Parties from the date of reinstatement. [Upon any such reinstatement of First Lien Obligations, each Second Lien Claimholder will deliver to First Lien Agent any Collateral or Proceeds thereof received between the Discharge of First Lien Obligations and their reinstatement in accordance with section 4.3, “Payment Turnover.”] [No Second Lien Claimholder may benefit from a Recovery, and any distribution made to a Second Lien Claimholder as a result of a Recovery will be paid over to First Lien Agent for application to the First Lien Obligations in accordance with section 4.1, “Application of Proceeds.”]

6.7.Ti=REORGANIZATION SECURITIES

Nothing in this Agreement prohibits or limits the right of a Second Lien Claimholder to receive and retain any debt or equity securities that are issued by a reorganized debtor pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan in connection with an Insolvency Proceeding[, provided that any debt securities received by a Second Lien Claimholder on account of a Second Lien Obligation that constitutes a “secured claim” within the meaning of section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code will be paid over or otherwise transferred to First Lien Agent for application in accordance with section 4.1, “Application of Proceeds,” unless such distribution is made under a plan that is consented to by the affirmative vote of all classes composed of the secured claims of First Lien Claimholders].

If, in an Insolvency Proceeding, debt Obligations of the reorganized debtor secured by Liens upon any property of the reorganized debtor are distributed pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, both on account of First Lien Obligations and on account of Second Lien Obligations, then, to the extent the debt Obligations distributed on account of the First Lien Obligations and on account of the Second Lien Obligations are secured by Liens upon the same property, the provisions of this Agreement will survive the distribution of such debt Obligations pursuant to such plan and will apply with like effect to the Liens securing such debt Obligations.

6.8.Ti=POST-PETITION CLAIMS

Second Lien Agent waives

6.9.1.sec=any claim it may hereafter have against any First Lien Claimholder arising out of any cash collateral or financing arrangement or out of any grant of a security interest in connection with the Collateral in an Insolvency Proceeding, so long as such actions are not in express contravention of the terms of this Agreement; [and]

6.9.2.sec=any right to assert or enforce any claim under section 506(c) or 552 of the Bankruptcy Code as against First Lien Claimholders or any of the Collateral to the extent securing the First Lien Obligations [; and

6.9.3.sec=solely in its capacity as a holder of a Lien on Collateral, any claim or cause of action that any Grantor may have against any First Lien Claimholder, except to the extent arising from a breach by such First Lien Claimholder of the provisions of this Agreement].

6.10.Ti=SEPARATE GRANTS OF SECURITY AND SEPARATE CLASSIFICATION

The grants of Liens pursuant to the First Lien Collateral Documents and the Second Lien Collateral Documents constitute two separate and distinct grants. Because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the Second Lien Obligations, to the extent deemed to be “secured claims” within the meaning of section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, are fundamentally different from the First Lien Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization in an Insolvency Proceeding. Second Lien Claimholders will not seek in an Insolvency Proceeding to be treated as part of the same class of creditors as First Lien Claimholders and will not oppose or contest any pleading by First Lien Claimholders seeking separate classification of their respective secured claims.

6.11.Ti=EFFECTIVENESS IN INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS

The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement is a “subordination agreement” under section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which will be effective before, during, and after the commencement of an Insolvency Proceeding.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior agreements, oral or written, relating to its subject matter.

7.3.Ti=EFFECTIVENESS; SEVERABILITY; TERMINATION

This Agreement will become effective when executed and delivered by the Parties.

Each First Lien Claimholder and each Second Lien Claimholder waives any right it may have under applicable law to revoke this Agreement or any provision thereunder or consent by it thereto.

This Agreement will survive, and continue in full force and effect, in any Insolvency Proceeding.

If a provision of this Agreement is prohibited or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, the prohibition or unenforceability will not invalidate the remaining provisions hereof, or invalidate or render unenforceable that provision in any other jurisdiction.

Subject to sections 1.6(d) and 1.6(g), “Pledged Collateral,” 4.1, “Application of Proceed,” 4.4, “Refinancing After Discharge of First Lien Obligations,” 6.5, “First Lien Objections to Second Lien Actions,” and 6.6, “Avoidance; Reinstatement of Obligations,” this Agreement will terminate and be of no further force and effect

7.3.1.sec=for First Lien Claimholders, upon the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, and

7.5.Ti=INFORMATION CONCERNING FINANCIAL CONDITION OF BORROWER AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

The Control Agent, First Lien Claimholders, and Second Lien Claimholders will each be responsible for keeping themselves informed of

7.5.1.sec=the financial condition of the Grantors, and

7.5.2.sec=all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the First Lien Obligations or the Second Lien Obligations.

Neither the Control Agent nor any First Lien Claimholder will have any duty to advise any Second Lien Claimholder, and no Second Lien Claimholder will have any duty to advise the Control Agent or any first Lien Claimholder, of information known to it regarding any such condition or circumstances or otherwise.

If the Control Agent or a First Lien Claimholder provides any such information to a Second Lien Claimholder, or a Second Lien Claimholder provides any such information to the Control Agent or any First Lien Claimholder, the Control Agent or the First Lien Claimholder, or Second Lien Claimholder, respectively, will have no obligation to:

Such payment or distribution will not reduce the Second Lien Obligations.

7.9.Ti=APPLICABLE LAW; JURISDICTION; SERVICE

This Agreement, and any claim or controversy relating to the subject matter hereof, will be governed by the law of the [State of New York].

All judicial proceedings brought against a Party arising out of or relating hereto may be brought in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in [the state, county, and city of New York]. Each Party irrevocably

7.9.1.sec=accepts generally and unconditionally the nonexclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts,

7.9.2.sec=waives any defense of forum nonconveniens, and

7.9.3.sec=agrees that service of process in such proceeding may be made by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Party at its address provided in accordance with section 7.11, “Notices,” and that such service will confer personal jurisdiction over the Party in such proceeding and otherwise constitutes effective and binding service in every respect.

7.13.Ti=SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of each First Lien Claimholder, each Second Lien Claimholder, the Control Agent, and their respective successors and assigns. However, no provision of this Agreement will inure to the benefit of a trustee, debtor-in-possession, creditor trust or other representative of an estate or creditor of Borrower, or other Grantor, including where such estate or creditor representative is the beneficiary of a Lien securing Collateral by virtue of the avoidance of such Lien in an Insolvency Proceeding.

If either First Lien Agent or Second Lien Agent resigns or is replaced pursuant to the First Lien Credit Agreement or Second Lien Credit Agreement, as applicable, its successor will be a party to this Agreement with all the rights, and subject to all the obligations, of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement may not be assigned to any Person except as expressly contemplated herein.

By its signature hereto, each Person signing this Agreement on behalf of a Party represents and warrants to the other Parties that it is duly authorized to execute this Agreement.

7.15.Ti=NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES
