/Note=First cut, for comment only.  The goal ultimately is to fully automate compliance and to refine the discussion in the community and with regulators (who are, after all, part of the community). 

Ti=New State BitLicense Compliance

0.sec={P1.The} has not obtained, and does not expect to apply for, a license  (a "{BitLicense}") from the New York State superintendent of financial services (the "{NY_Superintendent}") under Title 23, Chapter 1, Section 200 of the proposed regulation on virtual currencies (the "{BitReg}").  The {BitReg} requires that any person obtain a {BitLicense} before engaging in a "Virtual Currency Business Activity" ("{VCBA}").  ("{Section}" means a Section of the {BitReg} unless otherwise specified.) 

Secs={Exempt.Sec}<li>{Effect.Sec}

Exempt.Ti=Exemption

Exempt.0.sec={P1.The} believes that it is exempt from such licensing requirement on the following grounds:


Exempt.1.sec={P1.The} is chartered under the New York Banking Law and is approved by the superintendent to engage in {VCBA}.

Exempt.2.sec={P1.The} is a merchant or consumer that utilizes {Virtual_Currency} solely for the purchase or sale of goods or services or for investment purposes.

Exempt.3.sec=None of {P1.the}'s activities involve New York or a "{New_York_Resident}" as defined in the {BitReg}.

Exempt.4.sec={P1.The} is not engaged in a {VCBA} because it does not conduct any of the activities specified in {Section} 200.2(q)(1 through 5).

Exempt.5.sec={P1.The} is engaged only in the "development and dissemination of software in and of itself" per {Section} 200.2(q).


Exempt.=[02/Bit/Ssec_05]

Effect.Ti=Effect

Effect.0.sec=If {P1.the} were required to apply for a {BitLicense}, that could have an adverse effect on {P1.the}'s operations, including but not limited to the following:

Effect.1.sec={P1.The} could be required to suspend operations while it sought a {BitLicense}.

Effect.2.sec=The cost of applying for a {BitLicense} might be excessive.

Effect.3.sec={P1.The} might be ineligible for {BitLicense}.

Effect.4.sec=The {NY_Superintendent} might deny or delay the grant of a {BitLicense}.
