Ti=The Center for Decentralized Law


0.sec=This is an appeal for participation in and support for a "Center for Decentralized Law."  A public service that hosts text and promotes a bottom-up system of legal autonomy and harmonization.  The texts are created and used like open source software.

1.sec="Decentralized" law refers to the arrangements that the participants adopt to govern their own affairs.  That includes contracts, wills, organizational documents and permits.  Functionally, any document of legal significance that is signed or stamped.  Participants include individuals, businesses, agencies and courts.

2.sec=These kinds of documents are currently often handled via word processing, which imposes significant cost, delay and opacity in creation, review and management.

3.sec=These problems are greatly reduced when the text is handled as software "objects."

4.0.sec=Use cases include:

4.1.sec=Consumer agreements - personal and financial arrangements.

4.2.sec=Business agreements - lending, employment, consulting, licensing and services.

4.3.sec=Regulation - functional, decentralized regulation can be achieved via model documents used by the regulated persons.  For instance, privacy can be codified via model privacy policies, forked for various settings.  The "regulated" party enters into direct contractual obligations vis-a-vis its customer.  Violation becomes actionable by the customer and enforceable as an unfair trade practice or under other regulatory authority.

5.sec=CommonAccord, and its "Cmacc" data model, show how text can be handled efficiently, as precedents (software "objects").  This allows participants to create and use crowd-sourced terms in their private dealings, by forking a document, the repository or the data model.  This is fully decentralized.

6.sec=There is a need for one or more "centers" for this decentralized system.  Participants want well-developed and well-known solutions.  The Center for Decentralized Law will supervise the CommonAccord repository and activities under the names of CommonAccord and DecentLaw.  It will provide a forum for development of codified documents and systems.
