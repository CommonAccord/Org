Ti=Centralization, Smarts and the "Existential" Problem


1.sec=The world is coming together.  Or falling apart.  

2.sec=Mechanization, automation, transportation, and communication ("tech") have transformed the system of production.  Food production has been scaled so that it now occupies the efforts of only a small minority of people.  Manufacturing, which was where farm workers went, is also increasingly peopleless.  Office work, the characteristic form of employment of the late 20th Century, is easier to automate than these other tasks because it does not involve physical manipulations.

3.sec=So far, tech has resulted in extreme centralization of decision making.  One farmer decides what to plant and when to harvest on hundreds or thousands of acres. A group of designers decides what hundreds of thousands, or millions, of people are offered to wear, carry, or drive.  Company policy, regulation, or executive decision determines what's on the menu, whether our factory moves elsewhere, the streets get swept, our school offers art.  We listen to the same people on the radio and watch them on TV.  Social fabric is also centralized, so it might be municipal workers (police) who are charged with making our neighbors turn down the music or stop fighting.

4.sec=Social patterns have of course adapted to and exploited this new power.  The financial industry is a kind of meta-management layer, and good managers have to stay close, figuratively or literally, to its centers.  Those decision-makers interact closely with government.

5.sec=The progression of communications and computing, and the advent of artificial analysis that out runs human thought will further centralization, further empowering central decision-making.  At the same time, it can disempower the decision-makers.  The systems are largely opaque to top managers.  Security breaches are a symptom and harbinger of IT systems escaping the control of their "owners."

6.sec=Many of us, as citizens, believe that "the system" that organizes our streets, food, housing, education, and source of income has largely escaped our control.  But it is still largely run by people.  Will that get better, or worse, when artificial thought assumes a larger place, more control?

7.sec=A counter-weight would be to reinforce decentralized decision-making.  This fits a libertarian, Jeffersonian and Occupy agenda.  "Conservative" in the panda and polar bear sense.

8.sec=Conveniently, there is a very robust system of decentralized decision-making already in place, in the form of documents we sign.  School trip and construction permits, contracts, litigation documents.   These often reflect highly centralized requirements - laws, regulations, and market expectations - but are, oddly, created by one of the parties and vary in details.  These documents closely resemble one another, but when they become important, for instance in the event of a dispute, the exact, idiosyncratic wording matters. 

9.sec=Indeed, the law in most places on most issues lets the parties mostly legislate for themselves, so long as there is consent (e.g., signature).  Contract is the broadest category, covers a vast swath of dealings, and influences others other categories.  It is evocatively (if slightly inaccurately) said to be "the law of the parties."  This private legislation can be complemented with private judiciary - arbitration - creating a self-sealing system of party autonomy.  Arbitration has an astonishingly solid legal footing in the (many) countries that are signatories to the arbitration treaty. 

10.sec=This decentralized ecosystem is largely the result of word processing.  In an internet world, word processing is a thoroughly inappropriate way to handle transacting, but it has served to keep decentralized a lot of decision-making, with a rich system of materials and personnel.

11.sec=Most of this could be replaced by AI.  While AI is partly here, inevitable, and may have advantages for society as a whole, as opposed to merely providing competitive advantage to a subgroup, it's dangers should not be ignored. 

12.sec=An alternative path is to build on rather than replace the decentralized method of agreement.  To make it efficient, reduce its friction, complexity, and opacity.  That, we think, will be one of the effects of open-<b>sourcing</b> legal documents.  Like AI, this approach is profoundly disruptive for the those who have mastered the word processing ecosystem, but it is hoped that it can allow more focus on the substance of law and social organization.

13.sec=To do this, we need to keep the IT as simple as possible, open source it, teach it, push control close to the affected persons.  Lego, all the way down, or as far down as we can get it.
