Bitcoin Precipitates a Revolution in Governance and Law 

1. Bitcoin proved P2P payments, triggered a tsuanami of activity, including competing P2P solutions.

2. P2P forces friction-light transacting. Intermediaries will be reduced to their value add, which might be nothing.

3. Payments are the core of transacting - but there is more. The "more" is often intermediated by legal documents.

4. Legal document sourcing, can also be reduced to its value proposition. Documents are text - software engineers know how to handle text.

5. CommonAccord is source code for legal docs. On GitHub. Forkable.

5.1. Form docs to legal objects.

5.2. Open, commented, rated, interoperable, in all jurisdictions and languages.

5.3. A network of "Civil Codes 3.0"

5.4. Signature, identity, proof, payment, normal consequences all supplied by blockchain and "smart contracts" - or otherwise.

6. Pulling the vast community of legal document "miners" - lawyers, managers, regulators, legislators, citizens - into the P2P ecosystem.

7. Giving "us" - the edge - more leverage against the centers.
