Ti=Blockchain for self-governance

0.sec=This began as an idea for a Tweet storm, but I thought better of it.  What think you of:

1.sec=Blockchain enables P2P interface, makes me a peer with "my" suppliers

2.sec="Smart contracts" are account management functions - spreadsheet functions with teeth

3.sec=Interface is consistent, open source, done by best coders

4.sec=I have same records of transactions as "my" vendor

5.sec=My records interoperate, alert me, etc.

6.sec=Information can stay local to "us"

7.sec=No more relearning lousy vendor interfaces, stuff that should work but doesn't

8.sec="My" vendors (including "my" regulators) interoperate, focus on their value propositions

9.sec=Small vendors compete on more equal footing

10.sec=Many payments are conventional (in fiat) but ...

11.sec=The most interesting are non-fungible, relationship-reflecting IOUs - brightly colored coin

12.sec=And non-fiat competes on equal footing

13.sec=When "wrapped" in text (@yaoeo), the P2P "payment" platform becomes self-governance

14.sec=Burma-Shave!
